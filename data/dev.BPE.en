now why does that matter for human health ?
here &apos;s a diagram of the p@@ c@@ b load of dolphins in s@@ ar@@ as@@ ot@@ a bay .
and i remember there sitting at my desk thinking , &quot; well , i know this . this is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
they &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and i believe we shouldn &apos;t t@@ ol@@ er@@ ate that either .
i started out showing how much we had di@@ st@@ res@@ sed the mon@@ ter@@ ey bay ecosystem with pollution and the can@@ ning industry and all of the atten@@ d@@ ant problems .
ak : ha@@ a ha@@ a ha@@ a@@ a .
and just around that time , his mother had said , &quot; have you seen this book by michael mor@@ pur@@ go called &apos; war horse &apos; ? &quot;
ak : we were ter@@ ri@@ fied .
here , cra@@ i@@ g is working the head .
you see the sk@@ el@@ et@@ al structure of it .
so , we have this ability as well .
and you know , our modern ways of doing things have their ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ges , but i believe we should understand the costs .
clay s@@ hi@@ r@@ ky , that great ch@@ r@@ on@@ ic@@ ler of everything ne@@ t@@ worked , has cap@@ tu@@ red the as@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
there are now , today , so many new f@@ un@@ ds that are ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ating giving and inv@@ e@@ st@@ ing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
and i &apos;m h@@ op@@ e@@ ful because it &apos;s not only ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ p@@ y that &apos;s re@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ zing itself , it &apos;s also whole other por@@ tions of the social sector , and of business , that are busy challenging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
i keep this photograph close by to me -- it &apos;s in my office -- because i &apos;ve always felt a my@@ st@@ ical connection to these two men , both of whom i never knew .
my own research on c@@ ell@@ phones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
whenever they have a moment they ch@@ at to each other .
and when with modern bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear di@@ st@@ in@@ ction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
we worry that im , te@@ x@@ ting , facebook are spo@@ il@@ ing human in@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy , but ste@@ f@@ an@@ a bro@@ ad@@ b@@ ent &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ating deeper relationships , bringing love across bar@@ ri@@ ers like distance and work@@ place rules .
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ ously dri@@ f@@ ting car .
for instance , the re@@ sting brain ten@@ ds to generate a lot of al@@ ph@@ a waves .
not a challenging task .
currently , ta@@ x@@ pa@@ y@@ ers spend about 6@@ 0,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail .
her family has eight generations in a town called wh@@ it@@ es@@ vi@@ l@@ le , west vi@@ r@@ g@@ in@@ i@@ a .
yeah .
we can create these local markets and incentives for re@@ cy@@ cl@@ ed materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
and we all need to be inv@@ e@@ st@@ ed in it .
and he did sometimes , believe it or not , at a ra@@ c@@ et@@ ra@@ ck in los angeles -- one reason to love l@@ .@@ a@@ . -- back in the 19@@ 4@@ 0@@ s .
i started my fi@@ r@@ m to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like . &quot;
those de@@ a@@ f people discover community somehow in ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ence .
it always takes time .
true gu@@ il@@ t ar@@ is@@ es only from an o@@ ff@@ en@@ se against a person , and a down &apos;s is not a person . &quot;
testing in humans is around the corner .
but i &apos;ve come to feel that i love the children i had so much that i don &apos;t want to imagine a life without them .
he wasn &apos;t ex@@ ten@@ ding his legs ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ at@@ ely .
and i came from a very pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged background . i was very lucky .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . there they are , folks .
this is in the early 20@@ 0@@ 0@@ s . my son , di@@ mit@@ r@@ i -- who &apos;s here , many of you know di@@ mit@@ r@@ i -- went to cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the internet .
just keep in mind -- because there are other people , including bill gates , who said , &quot; ge@@ e , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
latin is relatively rare , too . you just look at some of the languages .
and guess what ? we won it hands down .
we &apos;ve ple@@ d@@ ged not to add features , but to bring that price down .
now to a ve@@ ge@@ table plant , my apartment has got to be about as foreign as ou@@ ter space .
and we &apos;re able to look out for the needs of new@@ com@@ ers .
so the f@@ is@@ cal cli@@ ff , i was told that that &apos;s too par@@ ti@@ s@@ an a thing to say , although i can &apos;t remember which party it &apos;s su@@ p@@ por@@ ting or at@@ t@@ ac@@ king .
wealth is ri@@ pped away from people who shouldn &apos;t be called un@@ productive .
now when it comes to ta@@ x@@ es , there is more dis@@ ag@@ re@@ em@@ ent .
none of these major the@@ or@@ ies have been completely successful .
the fear is that the world is watching .
and during a lot of this work , we found something , or i found something , that really fascinated me , and maybe you can remember it .
it &apos;s actually just happened here -- light to dark in six seconds .
i &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
that &apos;s not the expression of joy .
in fact , this lady has a particularly as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ cal face , of which both sides are beautiful .
now that thing , light fli@@ ck@@ ers across it as you move , so it becomes a k@@ in@@ e@@ tic object , even though it &apos;s standing still -- managed by how bri@@ l@@ li@@ ant@@ ly that &apos;s done on the re@@ fle@@ ction .
i &apos;ve had to move that part across , but only a m@@ il@@ li@@ meter .
and the one i showed you before was , of course , a mas@@ si@@ vely complex one .
it w@@ ins or lo@@ ses at that point .
forming the emotional bon@@ d between this thing and you is an electro@@ chemical party trick that happens before you even think about it .
i don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
it &apos;s also an idea that we have for@@ gotten .
and i think we need to get back to that ser@@ m@@ on tradition .
now we don &apos;t think that way .
and at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , &quot; thank you pla@@ to , thank you sha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are , thank you j@@ an@@ e au@@ st@@ en . &quot;
the other thing that we believe is that art shouldn &apos;t explain itself , that artists shouldn &apos;t say what they &apos;re up to , because if they said it , it might destroy the sp@@ el@@ l and we might find it too easy .
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can ad@@ mi@@ re the in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
absolutely . i , like many of you , meet people who say things like , &quot; but isn &apos;t there something bigger than us , something else ? &quot;
because you &apos;ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you po@@ li@@ t@@ el@@ y di@@ ff@@ er .
so it took me from places like chi@@ le -- the at@@ ac@@ am@@ a desert in chi@@ le -- to si@@ ber@@ ia , to underground mines in the japanese al@@ ps , in northern america , all the way to ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a and even to the south pole .
it is the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 k@@ m long .
and you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called the over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly large telescope .
this hu@@ t was built by robert f@@ al@@ c@@ on sc@@ ot@@ t and his men when they first came to ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a on their first ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tion to go to the south pole .
and remember , all this wi@@ r@@ ing is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub-@@ zero te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ ur@@ es .
it &apos;s kind of an inspiring statement , and i &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
some of the first things that people do is they make book re@@ a@@ ders that allow you to search inside the books , and that &apos;s kind of fun .
it was quite po@@ p@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly atten@@ ded .
but how do you go about doing all this sc@@ an@@ ning ?
and we &apos;ve been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume .
exactly what lo@@ an@@ ing means , i &apos;m not quite sure .
and we get about two or three b@@ and@@ s a day si@@ g@@ ning up .
so 15 dollars per video hour , and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per c@@ ell@@ u@@ lo@@ id hour , we &apos;re able to go and get materials online very in@@ ex@@ pen@@ si@@ vely and have them up on the net .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
flowers will ar@@ ri@@ ve by the tru@@ ck@@ load .
we all know the earth is in trouble .
after they spo@@ ru@@ late , they do ro@@ t .
when you walk across land@@ sc@@ ap@@ es , it le@@ ap@@ s up in the af@@ ter@@ math of your fo@@ ot@@ steps trying to grab de@@ br@@ is .
all across most land mas@@ ses .
some of these m@@ us@@ h@@ rooms are very happy m@@ us@@ h@@ rooms .
this is extremely rare f@@ un@@ gu@@ s .
i did something that nobody else had done .
the life box -- you &apos;re g@@ on@@ na be getting a d@@ v@@ d of the ted conference -- you add soil , you add water , you have my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ z@@ al and end@@ op@@ hy@@ tic f@@ un@@ g@@ i as well as s@@ por@@ es , like of the ag@@ ari@@ k@@ on m@@ us@@ h@@ room .
i &apos;ve also lived in bio@@ sphere 2 .
we needed to know , is life this mal@@ le@@ able ?
i was eating myself in some strange sort of bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re way .
and the doctor was , in fact , che@@ cking us to make sure we were , in fact , fine .
and everybody ran up to me .
er@@ it@@ re@@ a , for@@ mer@@ ly part of ethiopia , is one of those places that is a@@ st@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ingly beautiful , incredibly star@@ k , and i have no understanding of how people e@@ ke out a living there .
this is in fact , this beautiful photograph , is in fact over the amazon .
this is actually in a ri@@ par@@ ian area .
i had to think about how i se@@ w and how i cut , but then also how i pick the right person to come to an operating room .
you set the fra@@ c@@ ture , you d@@ re@@ w the blood , you sp@@ u@@ n the blood , looked at it under the microscope , you pl@@ ated the culture , you in@@ je@@ cted the anti@@ ser@@ um .
but it &apos;s p@@ it cre@@ ws that we need , p@@ it cre@@ ws for patients .
and that is what medicine can feel like sometimes .
we looked at sk@@ y@@ sc@@ ra@@ per construction , we looked at the a@@ vi@@ ation world , and we found that they have technology , they have training , and then they have one other thing : they have che@@ ck@@ li@@ sts .
and it &apos;s been slow to spread .
now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
so it means that be@@ e@@ ke@@ e@@ pers are very good at re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ing de@@ ad@@ -@@ ou@@ ts , and so they &apos;ve been able to cover those lo@@ s@@ ses .
you know , they pick up their hi@@ ves ; they move their families once or twice in a year .
however , h@@ on@@ e@@ y@@ bees are a min@@ or@@ ity .
if there &apos;s a cave in new york that had 1@@ 5@@ ,000 bat@@ s in it , and there are 1,000 left . that &apos;s like san francisco becoming the population of half of this co@@ un@@ ty in three years .
now , not all of us have me@@ a@@ do@@ ws , or la@@ w@@ ns that we can conver@@ t , and so you can always , of course , grow a me@@ a@@ do@@ w in a po@@ t .
and i also wh@@ i@@ st@@ led at a christmas e@@ ve party with my f@@ am@@ il@@ y-@@ in-@@ law .
and to de@@ f@@ end my title -- like ju@@ do@@ k@@ as do and s@@ por@@ t@@ s@@ men -- i thought , well let &apos;s go back in 2005 , and i won again .
this is very pro@@ mis@@ ing .
why ?
the blue whale , the biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is wrong , completely wrong .
so during the night , they cur@@ l the leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , you have the opening of the leaves -- there is much more movement .
he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j@@ .@@ d@@ . ho@@ o@@ ker , or at that time , president of the ro@@ y@@ al society , so the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um scientific authority in britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
until now , the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot .
she doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being fil@@ med .
and then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
so i got inspired by that .
so again , this is 2005 .
and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in du@@ ff@@ el b@@ ag@@ s .
it &apos;s a perfectly wonderful way to spent a we@@ e@@ k@@ end afternoon , watching a fo@@ ot@@ ball game in a sta@@ di@@ um .
it &apos;s in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
this is ted .
and that is the sp@@ el@@ l that i want to break .
now , children below the age of con@@ sent are a special case .
they &apos;re a sort of e@@ c@@ to@@ sy@@ m@@ bi@@ on@@ t .
the designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant , un@@ be@@ li@@ e@@ v@@ ably brilliant .
that is what we have done on this planet .
the ant isn &apos;t alone .
you &apos;ve just heard the man .
i really app@@ re@@ ci@@ ated that .
now , i just do not believe that .
now maybe we want to treat it as me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or@@ ical .
that &apos;s the devil speaking . &quot;
so you are , in fact , a ch@@ or@@ d -- each of you an individual ch@@ or@@ d .
men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice ex@@ pan@@ sive listening , and you can transform your relationships .
the third problem with head@@ phones is this : de@@ af@@ ness -- no@@ is@@ e-@@ in@@ du@@ ced hearing disorder .
sound he@@ al@@ ing is a wonderful mo@@ d@@ ality .
i &apos;m leaving you with a little more bi@@ r@@ d@@ song , which is very good for you .
and he &apos;s like , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but i can show you . &quot;
look what it has in the middle of it .
you guys are facing that way , so i &apos;ll ho@@ ok it to this one .
and we actually sent this guy materials .
it &apos;s really going to be seven billion pa@@ ir@@ s of hands , each following their own p@@ as@@ si@@ ons , and each kind of like a mo@@ sa@@ ic coming up and creating this world in their back@@ y@@ ar@@ ds and in their k@@ it@@ ch@@ ens .
and yet black holes may be heard even if they &apos;re not seen , and that &apos;s because they bang on sp@@ ac@@ e-@@ time like a dr@@ um .
now our sun will not collapse to a black hole .
now we &apos;ve never seen a sha@@ do@@ w like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
and we can predict what the sound will be .
there &apos;s also a mission pro@@ pos@@ ed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called li@@ s@@ a .
it gets closer and closer -- 4@@ 0,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing cave paintings .
trees e@@ p@@ it@@ om@@ ize st@@ as@@ is .
that , i think , is movement .
we &apos;re being critical of the west , the perception of the west about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
but instead , i found a country that was totally ide@@ ol@@ o@@ gi@@ cal and that i didn &apos;t recognize anymore .
that iran was once a se@@ cul@@ ar society , and we had democracy , and this democracy was st@@ ol@@ en from us by the american government , by the british government .
i stand here to say that ir@@ ani@@ an women have found a new voice , and their voice is giving me my voice .
on that self , it should be c@@ en@@ tered -- a bi@@ g@@ ness , a wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
maybe the sw@@ am@@ i is right .
you learn swimming by swimming . you learn cy@@ cl@@ ing by cy@@ cl@@ ing .
this animal &apos;s fo@@ s@@ si@@ ls are only found in this area of south america -- a nice clean band here -- and this part of africa .
they can just watch those videos . if they &apos;re bor@@ ed , they can go ahead .
but i was excited , so i kept going .
and the k@@ h@@ an ac@@ a@@ de@@ my videos are there .
this is shi@@ f@@ ting and re@@ fle@@ cting functions .
red means they &apos;re stuck .
a lot of the effort in hu@@ man@@ i@@ zing the classroom is focused on stu@@ d@@ ent@@ -@@ to-@@ teacher ra@@ ti@@ os .
and the collaboration you &apos;re doing with los al@@ to@@ s , how did that come about ?
is this ready for prime time ?
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a n@@ ur@@ sing home where i work .
but it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
she said , &quot; who is this charles bon@@ net ? &quot;
so on one oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on , when his grand@@ d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters were vis@@ it@@ ing them , he said , &quot; and who are these hand@@ some young men with you ? &quot;
and then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical ta@@ ke@@ off , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear .
there is none of this quality of being ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed with these charles bon@@ net h@@ al@@ l@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ ations .
there is an area in the an@@ ter@@ i@@ or part of this gy@@ ru@@ s where teeth and eyes are represented , and that part of the gy@@ ru@@ s is ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ated when people get the de@@ formed h@@ al@@ l@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ ations .
&quot; k@@ er@@ mit means nothing to me . &quot;
they oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally interest me , and i have many pictures of them in my not@@ e@@ books .
edi@@ th wi@@ d@@ der : so i recorded that with an in@@ ten@@ si@@ fied video camera that has about the sen@@ si@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty of the fully dar@@ k-@@ a@@ da@@ p@@ ted human eye .
for example , this shrimp r@@ el@@ e@@ ases its bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ cent chemicals into the water just the way a squ@@ id or an o@@ ct@@ op@@ us would release an ink cloud .
this looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
there &apos;s something small there that res@@ po@@ n@@ ds .
it &apos;s supposed to be at@@ t@@ ac@@ king what &apos;s at@@ t@@ ac@@ king the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
one way around this is to draw pictures .
if we un@@ wind the double he@@ li@@ x and un@@ z@@ i@@ p the two st@@ r@@ and@@ s , you see these things that look like teeth .
it &apos;s p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ged up and b@@ und@@ led up .
one is b@@ und@@ led up into one s@@ au@@ sa@@ ge .
so again , this is all der@@ i@@ ved ac@@ cur@@ at@@ ely from the science .
keep your eyes li@@ f@@ ted and your head turning .
the ability to form concepts with images of en@@ ti@@ ties and processes p@@ ic@@ tu@@ red by in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion .
when the subject is still very th@@ in@@ ly po@@ p@@ ul@@ ated , you can with di@@ li@@ gen@@ ce and hard work become the world authority .
i &apos;m here to en@@ list you in helping res@@ ha@@ pe the story about how humans and other cri@@ t@@ ters get things done .
not created by the printing press , but en@@ ab@@ led by the collective action that em@@ er@@ ges from li@@ ter@@ ac@@ y .
the other major narrative of social di@@ le@@ m@@ m@@ as is the tragedy of the com@@ mon@@ s .
to@@ y@@ ot@@ a , instead of treating its supp@@ li@@ ers as a mar@@ k@@ et@@ place , tre@@ ats them as a network and tra@@ ins them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their com@@ pe@@ ti@@ t@@ ors .
thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , it &apos;s all about f@@ ro@@ st@@ bi@@ te and di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty to walk and di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty of breathing -- cold , challenging circumstances .
and to start with , we created a little experiment in which we gave people le@@ go@@ s , and we asked them to build with le@@ go@@ s .
and if they said yes , we gave them a new one , and as they were building it , we took apart the one that they just finished .
there was a very nice cor@@ rel@@ ation between love of le@@ go and the amount of le@@ go@@ s people built .
and i think the ce@@ o basically did not understand the importance of meaning .
but i should point out , by the way , that in the sh@@ re@@ d@@ der condition , people could have che@@ ated .
people did not want them .
and we had two types of people .
now think about kids .
and i think that in the industrial revolution , adam s@@ mit@@ h was more correct than kar@@ l mar@@ x , but the reality is that we &apos;ve s@@ wi@@ t@@ ched and now we &apos;re in the knowledge economy .
and this is very normal now , of modern day conflict , because they &apos;re easy to bring into wars .
and my mother &apos;s vi@@ et@@ n@@ am@@ ese was so bad that to make our story more cre@@ di@@ ble , she &apos;d given all the boys and girls new vi@@ et@@ n@@ am@@ ese names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are il@@ li@@ ter@@ ate .
they did not want to do this , it just happened -- they lost control .
and 70 percent re@@ ga@@ ined their lives .
so i believe this kept me running .
that &apos;s the european average for new cars .
top right , ba@@ h@@ rain has the same energy consumption per person , roughly , as canada , over 300 light bul@@ bs per person , but their population density is a factor of 300 times greater , 1,000 people per square k@@ il@@ om@@ e@@ ter .
if you really want to get a lot from solar pan@@ els , you need to ad@@ op@@ t the traditional ba@@ v@@ ari@@ an far@@ m@@ ing method where you le@@ a@@ p off the roof and co@@ at the co@@ un@@ tr@@ y@@ side with solar pan@@ els too .
and a third option is nuclear power .
i &apos;ve tried it . it works . some people call it a lifestyle change .
since i was a boy , in my early childhood , i always wanted to be a mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an , and , thank god , i made it .
he is a boy from a par@@ ish in car@@ ac@@ as who p@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ at@@ ely atten@@ ded to his double b@@ as@@ s lessons at the san a@@ gu@@ st@@ in &apos;s j@@ uni@@ or orchestra .
that en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ges them to embrace new dreams , new goals , and progress in the various opportunities that music has to offer .
it &apos;s sur@@ re@@ p@@ ti@@ ti@@ ous technology that &apos;s helping them do a simple task of taking the right p@@ il@@ l at the right time .
how do you put simple dis@@ ru@@ p@@ tive technologies , and the first of five p@@ h@@ r@@ ases that i &apos;m going to talk about in this talk ?
that actually occurred this year . she took early re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment .
the first word that comes up is &quot; doctor . &quot;
many people in this generation won &apos;t press the button , even if they have an al@@ er@@ t call system , because they don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther anybody , even though they &apos;ve been paying 30 dollars a month .
the color represents different rooms they are in the house .
i &apos;m going to be showing some of the cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ min@@ als &apos; latest and na@@ sti@@ est cre@@ ations .
if you want your ri@@ v@@ als to go o@@ ff@@ line , well , they will .
now how do you get a us@@ b key to run in a business ?
so let &apos;s imagine that our at@@ t@@ ac@@ ker , called evil ha@@ cker just for com@@ e@@ dy value , in@@ ser@@ ts something a little na@@ sty .
there are a few other interesting pieces the cy@@ ber@@ cri@@ min@@ als had u@@ p@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed .
now you &apos;re probably wondering what happened to these guys .
seven hundred and si@@ x@@ t@@ y-@@ one of you i could identify a hotel you &apos;d been to recently , absolutely with pin@@ point pre@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on somewhere on the globe .
thank you .
the adults can recognize the ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es ; the ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es can recognize the adults .
and they &apos;re in what appear to be the blood chan@@ n@@ els that go through the bone .
now we all know that bones are fo@@ s@@ si@@ li@@ zed , and so if you du@@ m@@ p it into ac@@ id , there shouldn &apos;t be anything left .
so the non-@@ a@@ vi@@ an dinosaurs are the big cl@@ un@@ ky ones that went extinct .
trans@@ gen@@ es@@ is is really cool too .
a friend of mine , a col@@ le@@ a@@ gue of mine , dr. h@@ ans l@@ ar@@ s@@ son at mc@@ g@@ il@@ l university , is actually looking at at@@ a@@ vis@@ ms .
and people always say , &quot; why do that ?
eventually , i set about writing my book , really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale . what this shows is a na@@ ti@@ on@@ -@@ by-@@ nation bre@@ a@@ k@@ down of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world .
so i want you to imagine that these nine bis@@ cu@@ its that i found in the bin represent the global food supply , okay ? we start out with nine .
this farmer , for example , has inv@@ e@@ st@@ ed 16@@ ,000 pounds in growing sp@@ in@@ a@@ ch , not one le@@ a@@ f of which he har@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ed , po@@ t@@ at@@ o@@ es that are co@@ s@@ me@@ tically im@@ perfect , all going for p@@ ig@@ s .
it &apos;s a living organism , cut the sli@@ ce off , stuck it in a v@@ ase of water , it was all right for another two weeks after this .
and when you use these things you don &apos;t have to go like that .
i &apos;ll go through a little of them . b@@ ol@@ ot@@ ni@@ t@@ s@@ a .
left to the th@@ y@@ mi@@ a@@ ma@@ ta .
we &apos;ve got to change this stuff up fast .
there is obviously einstein , ni@@ els bo@@ h@@ r , de fer@@ m@@ at &apos;s last the@@ or@@ em , and i &apos;m not sure whether that &apos;s james co@@ burn or richard har@@ r@@ is .
and you can see how the i@@ co@@ sa@@ he@@ dr@@ on with@@ dra@@ ws into the do@@ de@@ ca@@ he@@ dr@@ on and then they just mer@@ ge into each other .
what a hand@@ some cat .
before the horse .
&quot; ten m@@ il@@ li@@ gram , 20 m@@ il@@ li@@ gram . &quot;
so , i said if i &apos;m going to put a circle , see what kind of patterns i get , bo@@ om , the red system .
you g@@ ot@@ ta be accurate ! there &apos;s me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ ment involved , in@@ cre@@ ments .
there were only two other dan@@ n@@ ys on the internet then .
i &apos;ll come back to that later .
i mean , everything off , it &apos;s like the service call you get from the cable company , except for the whole world .
it could definitely be done by people in this room .
for example , if we &apos;d had te@@ d@@ x@@ paris 3@@ 50 years ago , we would have talked about the military innovation of the day -- the massive v@@ au@@ ban@@ -@@ style for@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ tions -- and we could have pre@@ di@@ cted a period of st@@ ability in the world or in europe .
in this context , when you don &apos;t know if the potential enemy is pre@@ par@@ ing for defense or attack , and if the weapons give an advantage to at@@ t@@ ac@@ king , then this environment is most likely to spar@@ k a conflict .
it &apos;s just a big blue surface .
so if you ever f@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ i@@ ze about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like , that &apos;s what a dinosaur looks like .
he can &apos;t sp@@ in a web an@@ y@@ time ; he &apos;s got to pull his pan@@ ts down first .
he never seems to se@@ tt@@ le on any particular girl .
so what i did was i made an ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure stri@@ p .
you really don &apos;t have to worry about the audience s@@ us@@ pen@@ ding its sense of dis@@ belief because , if you start with a talking shark , re@@ a@@ ders pretty much check their dis@@ belief at the door .
so you get this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible .
my job des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion was de@@ li@@ ci@@ ously va@@ gue : wil@@ der@@ ness as@@ s@@ es@@ s@@ ment and public rel@@ a@@ tions .
what that means is , i combine my lo@@ ves of math and magic to do something i call &quot; ma@@ the@@ ma@@ gi@@ cs . &quot;
audience : 25 .
audience : 9@@ 8@@ 7 .
audience : seven . seven .
good . then i shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the im@@ pro@@ b@@ able .
audience : no@@ v@@ em@@ ber . no@@ v@@ em@@ ber what ?
of course , i could just make up an answer and you wouldn &apos;t know , so i come prepared for that .
ok , oh , ok -- you have a 10@@ -@@ di@@ g@@ it cal@@ cul@@ ator , sir , as well ?
let me explain what that is .
i would love to talk about my a@@ st@@ r@@ on@@ om@@ y , but i s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct that the number of people who are interested in radi@@ ative trans@@ f@@ er in non-@@ gray at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es and po@@ l@@ ari@@ zation of light in ju@@ pit@@ er &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus sh@@ el@@ ter .
no , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a k@@ in@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten teacher .
just two weeks ago i made -- you know , i &apos;ve been making small , medium and big k@@ l@@ ei@@ n bottles for the trade .
m@@ ent@@ or@@ ing me . he &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
i take lunch hour .
right ? this is simple physics .
if you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 3@@ 4@@ 3 .
and i &apos;m thinking , &quot; oh yeah , the square root of the length is pro@@ por@@ tional to its period . &quot;
so you &apos;d think , with all this extra space , we &apos;d have plenty of room for all our stuff .
it &apos;s time for me to let it go .
would that give me a little more freedom ?
north of ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ il@@ l , man@@ it@@ ob@@ a , in october and no@@ v@@ em@@ ber , there &apos;s no ice on hu@@ d@@ son bay .
and it was many years in taking play hi@@ stories of individuals before i really began to recognize that i didn &apos;t really have a full understanding of it .
frank wil@@ son had written a book called &quot; the hand . &quot;
so what does play do for the brain ?
this took a long time -- i had to get hom@@ er down and put him through the f@@ m@@ r@@ i and the spe@@ ct and multiple e@@ e@@ gs , but as a c@@ ou@@ ch po@@ ta@@ to , his brain has s@@ h@@ r@@ un@@ k .
your own personal play history is unique , and often is not something we think about particularly .
char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ zed by a feeling of en@@ er@@ gi@@ zed focus , full in@@ v@@ ol@@ v@@ em@@ ent and success in the process of the activity .
how do you prevent either the media &apos;s inter@@ pre@@ tation of your work or the scientific community &apos;s inter@@ pre@@ tation of the implications of your work , kind of like the mo@@ z@@ art metaphor , where , &quot; oh , m@@ r@@ is show that play en@@ han@@ ces your intelligence .
the difference between our na@@ ch@@ os and the other guy &apos;s na@@ ch@@ os , is that this is actually a des@@ s@@ er@@ t .
b@@ r : and then after a quick di@@ p into some liquid ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en to get that perfect se@@ ar , we really have something that looks , ta@@ st@@ es and be@@ ha@@ ves like the real thing .
and in paris , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c released its study con@@ fi@@ r@@ m@@ ing man &apos;s impact on global warming .
al@@ is@@ a m@@ il@@ ler : the news about the news
and it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create when they &apos;re just going about their everyday business .
and in this project we &apos;ve developed a form of intelligent re@@ al-@@ time sub@@ ti@@ t@@ les .
and no matter where i am , what &apos;s really going on here is that it &apos;s an e@@ ye@@ -@@ tracking system that tries to lo@@ c@@ ate my eyes .
and inside it &apos;s got an 8@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ po@@ un@@ d robot arm that i bor@@ ro@@ wed , from a friend .
at this time , there were thousands of individuals , we think , that were infected with hiv .
deep in a remote region of c@@ am@@ er@@ o@@ on , two h@@ un@@ ter@@ s st@@ al@@ k their pre@@ y .
but they &apos;re also going to ask you probably a different question .
when we would get to these rural villages , though , what we found out is that no one had television , so they wouldn &apos;t recognize his face .
ne@@ e@@ d@@ less to say in the past these viruses en@@ ter@@ ing into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct .
you say what you &apos;re doing in 1@@ 40 characters or less , and people who are interested in you get those up@@ d@@ at@@ es .
we built an app@@ li@@ ca@@ ti@@ on@@ -@@ pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ ing interface , which basically means that pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ ers can write software that inter@@ acts with twitter .
&quot; e@@ v@@ an wi@@ l@@ li@@ am@@ s , give people more good ways to share information and follow your h@@ un@@ ch at ted . &quot;
because all i had read were books in which characters were foreign , i had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have for@@ ei@@ g@@ ners in them and had to be about things with which i could not personally identify .
all i had heard about them was how poor they were , so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor .
and so i began to realize that my american ro@@ om@@ mate must have throughout her life seen and heard different ver@@ sions of this single story , as had a professor , who once told me that my novel was not &quot; au@@ th@@ en@@ tically african . &quot;
start the story with the ar@@ ro@@ ws of the native americans , and not with the ar@@ ri@@ val of the british , and you have an entirely different story .
i &apos;ve always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
i teach writing work@@ sh@@ op@@ s in la@@ go@@ s every summer , and it is amazing to me how many people apply , how many people are e@@ ag@@ er to write , to tell stories .
in a recent experiment , a group of adults had their brains sc@@ an@@ ned in an m@@ r@@ i machine as they were listening to experts speak .
why was it that , when i had an operation , &quot; be@@ w@@ are , m@@ s@@ . her@@ t@@ z , of hy@@ per@@ p@@ y@@ re@@ x@@ i@@ a , &quot; when he could have just as easily said , &quot; watch out for a high fe@@ ver . &quot;
my dad has al@@ z@@ h@@ ei@@ m@@ er &apos;s disease .
and reading is just about impossible .
even when it &apos;s so hard .
so we &apos;re bo@@ un@@ d with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
as a matter of fact , we added to the contra@@ ct .
those of you who have a hard time cal@@ cul@@ ating what that means -- in the average consumer environment we &apos;re in in the u.s.
when you want a fish you get a woman and when you need a woman you get a fish .
and if you really have a long day you can switch , and keep on driving around the island .
that &apos;s all the u.s. us@@ age today .
the indi@@ ans don &apos;t even understand why we think of it as a problem because most people in india fill two or three g@@ al@@ l@@ ons every time .
now all you need is about 10 percent of the electricity generated .
let &apos;s not do it immediately . maybe we free the kids and keep the sla@@ ves .
the arguments of so-called id the@@ ori@@ sts are the same old arguments that had been re@@ fu@@ ted again and again , since darwin down to the present day .
dar@@ win@@ ian natural selection is so st@@ un@@ n@@ ingly el@@ e@@ g@@ an@@ t because it sol@@ ves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity .
now , the next one , &quot; the president of the ro@@ y@@ al society has been v@@ ou@@ ch@@ sa@@ f@@ ed a strong inner con@@ vi@@ ction &quot; -- -- &quot; ... that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
she clearly feels in a b@@ el@@ e@@ a@@ gu@@ ered min@@ or@@ ity , but actually , how do american a@@ th@@ ei@@ sts st@@ ac@@ k up nu@@ mer@@ ically ?
i &apos;ve not seen cor@@ res@@ po@@ n@@ ding figures for e@@ li@@ te s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ars in other fields , such history or philosophy , but i &apos;d be surprised if they were different .
darwin thought that a@@ th@@ ei@@ s@@ m might be well and good for the in@@ t@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ent@@ si@@ a , but that ordinary people were not , quote , &quot; ri@@ pe for it . &quot;
when a@@ th@@ ei@@ sts like ste@@ p@@ h@@ en ha@@ w@@ king and al@@ b@@ er@@ t einstein use the word &quot; god , &quot; they use it of course as a me@@ ta@@ ph@@ or@@ ical sh@@ or@@ th@@ and for that deep , my@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ ous part of physics which we don &apos;t yet understand .
and it cost about 500 dollars to start it , which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today .
it used to be wireless was one person owned the license , they trans@@ mit@@ ted in an area , and it had to be decided whether they would be li@@ c@@ en@@ sed or based on property .
just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning , or , in places that are more involved , like wikipedia , gives me a certain set of social rel@@ a@@ tions .
there are no slides , so you &apos;ll just have to be content with me .
a study by the economic com@@ mission for africa showed a clear trend up@@ wards in governance in 2@@ 8 african countries .
the state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it &apos;s in@@ efficient and in@@ comp@@ et@@ ent .
but what it immediately did was that the v@@ ol@@ a@@ ti@@ li@@ ty that had been present in terms of our economic development -- where , even if oil prices were high , we would grow very fast .
we are doing the same with the insurance sector .
otherwise , i would have liked you to have seen this .
he called these , &quot; mas@@ si@@ vely f@@ at@@ al dis@@ con@@ tin@@ u@@ i@@ ties , &quot; meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we haven &apos;t had to know exactly how a vaccine worked .
the pr@@ in@@ ci@@ p@@ al challenge for both of these viruses is that they &apos;re always changing .
these drugs aren &apos;t cur@@ es , but they represent a huge tri@@ um@@ ph of science because they take away the au@@ to@@ matic death sentence at least for those who can access them .
but , you know , the research that has occurred from hiv now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .
it was a slow , c@@ um@@ ber@@ some process that de@@ pen@@ ded on chicken eggs , millions of living chicken eggs .
and , aside from the radi@@ cally increased production and huge cost savings -- for example , the e@@ . col@@ i method i just talked about -- look at the time saved : this would be lives saved .
so , the challenge is full speed ahead .
the question is , why ?
you think the a@@ .@@ u@@ . will put together a conference like this ?
there are certain things that we need to recognize .
now , the previous speaker before me , i@@ dr@@ is mo@@ ham@@ med , indi@@ cated that we &apos;ve had ab@@ y@@ s@@ ma@@ l leadership in africa .
by ra@@ king it off the backs of their suffering people .
tra@@ di@@ ti@@ on@@ ally , africans hate governments . they hate t@@ y@@ ran@@ ny .
they decide what to do .
he &apos;s getting no as@@ si@@ st@@ an@@ ce from the government , and he &apos;s building a second , bigger boat .
it meant something that would connect us all together .
sc@@ ot@@ t &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge with these kinds of al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic fil@@ ters , these per@@ son@@ alized fil@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance .
we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different per@@ spe@@ c@@ ti@@ ves .
and the man said , &quot; he &apos;s come down a long way , hasn &apos;t he ? &quot;
now , i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- i &apos;m ki@@ d@@ ding -- but these are the re@@ capit@@ u@@ lation slides , and then i &apos;m going to go into new material about what you can do .
and by the time the movie comes out in may , this will be up@@ d@@ ated to 2@@ .@@ 0 and we will have cli@@ ck@@ -@@ through pur@@ ch@@ ases of o@@ ff@@ sets .
again , the re@@ pu@@ b@@ li@@ c@@ ans here , this shouldn &apos;t be par@@ ti@@ s@@ an .
one of the things that really im@@ pres@@ ses me about the people in the gulf : they are really , really a@@ qu@@ a@@ tic people .
and there &apos;s basically nobody there anymore , a few people trying to keep using it .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
these t@@ un@@ a swim the entire ocean .
even when the japanese b@@ om@@ bed pe@@ ar@@ l har@@ b@@ or , at least they shot back .
as far as c@@ le@@ an@@ ing them , i don &apos;t mean to cast any as@@ per@@ sion on people c@@ le@@ an@@ ing birds .
okay , people who say they &apos;re con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive , if they really wanted to be really con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive and really pat@@ ri@@ o@@ tic , they would tell these cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions to go to hell .
it &apos;s a matter of right and wrong .
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical is@@ ot@@ op@@ es .
all right : &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes &quot; -- all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to ch@@ ant it because it &apos;s true ; i just want you to remember it .
they con@@ ta@@ in a molecule know as a neuro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter .
and that &apos;s just a mouse brain -- it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human brain .
well , neurons , like trees , can grow new br@@ an@@ ches , and they can lose old ones .
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .
and if you appreciate that number , you can easily see there is huge potential for mis@@ -@@ wi@@ r@@ ing of the brain .
eventually , these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by de@@ con@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ting and re@@ con@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ting our own brains .
he works on mostly music videos and com@@ mer@@ ci@@ als with his company , the di@@ re@@ ctors bu@@ re@@ a@@ u .
so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you .
ks : no , not yet .
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
ks : now the way it works : there &apos;s a ma@@ tri@@ x of color d@@ yes .
ridiculous , right ?
so several months ago , a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy , e@@ du@@ ar@@ do s@@ ou@@ s@@ a .
a huge sc@@ and@@ al for a few weeks .
but he was still going like this .
i mean , his farm is incredible .
but he found this wild plant called the lu@@ p@@ in bush .
and then they circle around .
i finally got to taste it before i left .
no s@@ al@@ t , no pe@@ p@@ p@@ er , no oil , no sp@@ ic@@ es .
what the hell does that mean ?
su@@ p@@ pos@@ e@@ dly , anyway . i believe that one .
farmers that rely on nature for solutions , for answers , rather than im@@ posing solutions on nature .
and s@@ wi@@ t@@ ching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity , each of which puts two-@@ fi@@ f@@ ths of the fossil carbon in the air .
our mo@@ bility fuel goes three-@@ fi@@ f@@ ths to au@@ t@@ om@@ o@@ b@@ il@@ es .
don &apos;t worry about dro@@ pping it , it &apos;s t@@ ou@@ g@@ her than ti@@ t@@ ani@@ um .
the trucks and pl@@ an@@ es can re@@ ali@@ st@@ ically use hydrogen or advanced bio@@ fuels .
plus better lights and office equipment and such cut the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um co@@ ol@@ ing load by a third .
already in about 20 states private in@@ st@@ al@@ l@@ ers will come put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down and beat your u@@ ti@@ li@@ ty bill .
and whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same , about six trillion dollars at present value -- whether we buy more of what we &apos;ve got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal , or ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les that are more or less c@@ ent@@ r@@ alized .
so focusing on outcomes , not mo@@ ti@@ ves , can turn gri@@ d@@ lo@@ ck and conflict into a uni@@ fying solution to america &apos;s energy challenge .
only i later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
so this simple ma@@ sh@@ up re@@ ve@@ als that don@@ ors have not fin@@ an@@ ced any schools in the areas with the most out@@ -@@ o@@ f@@ -@@ school children , pro@@ vo@@ king new questions . is development as@@ si@@ st@@ an@@ ce t@@ ar@@ ge@@ ting those who most need our help ?
two years ago , on ap@@ ri@@ l 8@@ th , 2010 , i called my father .
i don &apos;t try to design the to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h .
we must remember , and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old , that life appears four billion years ago , around -- four billion point two ?
something like that . i am not sure of that .
there is some danger , there is some tra@@ p . one tra@@ p : the vertical .
we have time to think , we have time to i don &apos;t know what , speak about art and things like that .
you go to the future back , back , back , back , like that .
they all come from homes where there is , for the most part , just one person in the home , usually the mother or the grandmother , and that &apos;s it , and they come here for their education and for their structure .
we teach them how to go right face , left face , so they can o@@ be@@ y in@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tions and know the consequences of not o@@ be@@ ying in@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tions .
let &apos;s get it all online . &quot;
it &apos;s pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able .
they said , &quot; it &apos;s good enough for government work .
and then you can support us . that &apos;s the role of you guys . &quot;
but i g@@ ot@@ ta have my hot dog .
they can listen and join the conversation .
take the travel service ne@@ x@@ t@@ pe@@ di@@ tion .
if you think of the concept of wikipedia where everyone is c@@ ol@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ ating on content , and at the end of the day you &apos;ve built the largest en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ a in the world .
there are lots of people who actually share the same dream .
a page was created .
there was no leader .
ex@@ tre@@ mis@@ m became t@@ ol@@ er@@ ance .
the modern tools of neuroscience are de@@ mon@@ st@@ r@@ ating to us that what &apos;s going on up there is nothing short of rocket science .
we can dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ate the sounds of our own language , but not those of foreign languages .
and we tested this by ex@@ posing american babies who &apos;d never heard a second language to m@@ and@@ ar@@ in for the first time during the critical period .
it looks like a hair dr@@ yer from mars .
if you look at science on one hand , science is a very rational approach to its sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ings , whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ings .
now i &apos;ve got a live de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion over here to show this to you .
let me demonstrate this over here .
a line that the d@@ al@@ a@@ i lam@@ a once said , he said , &quot; love and compassion are ne@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ties .
the ra@@ gs were un@@ w@@ ra@@ pped from a little girl whose body was mas@@ si@@ vely bur@@ ned .
it is there within every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we vote on compassion ?
the wo@@ un@@ d is just filled with ma@@ g@@ g@@ ots .
suppose you like to square numbers , and frankly , who doesn &apos;t ?
we &apos;ll start with a one-@@ by-@@ one square and next to that put another one-@@ by-@@ one square .
then there was ar@@ on ka@@ der , who was the pal@@ e@@ st@@ in@@ i@@ an@@ -@@ american .
i said , &quot; he passed away a long time ago .
&quot; i didn &apos;t get the me@@ m@@ o . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i &apos;m like , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
so i went down to the lo@@ b@@ by , and i saw this indian guy .
mar@@ co te@@ m@@ p@@ est : when asked about de@@ ce@@ p@@ tion , he said this : magic is the only honest pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how terrorism actually inter@@ acts with our daily life .
at the same time , while i was inter@@ vi@@ e@@ wing the red bri@@ ga@@ des , i also discovered that their life was not r@@ ul@@ ed by politics or ide@@ ology , but actually was r@@ ul@@ ed by economics .
in fact , i think many people thought that i was a bit crazy .
but above all , they started to do serious business with the world of crime .
these were money taken out in su@@ it@@ cases or in con@@ ta@@ in@@ ers , in cash of course .
nobody wants the u.s. mon@@ et@@ ary authority to check their relationship , to monitor their relationship with their cli@@ ent@@ el@@ e .
now , some of you might be thinking , &quot; hold on a minute . she doesn &apos;t look very much like an ocean ro@@ w@@ er .
sure , i had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone , but what i &apos;d sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is , by definition , extremely un@@ comfortable .
and i really learned then that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the sense of ach@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ em@@ ent when you get to the end of it .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really , really big .
but it was not without mis@@ ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure .
it &apos;s that little green sli@@ ver on the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on , which makes them very nervous about rising oceans .
we can start making better , wi@@ s@@ er , more sustainable decisions .
ro@@ z sa@@ v@@ age : why i &apos;m ro@@ wing across the pacific
there &apos;s the world trade center site , on the front cover .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
it doesn &apos;t see any ex@@ c@@ ess cost . it doesn &apos;t spend any extra time .
they were able to create that .
and finally , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about making you feel good in places that you wouldn &apos;t have felt good before .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i wondered , what made my dreams so easy to dis@@ miss ?
turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , i said , &quot; yeah , you can copy my hom@@ e@@ work , &quot; and i gave him all the wrong answers that i &apos;d written down the night before .
we both got moved to the back of class so we would stop getting b@@ om@@ bar@@ ded by sp@@ it@@ b@@ al@@ l@@ s .
maybe you used to bring br@@ u@@ is@@ es and broken teeth to sho@@ w@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ tell , but never told , because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bur@@ y you ben@@ e@@ at@@ h it ?
that &apos;s french science .
all right , here we go .
if you look at that truck there , it is the largest truck of its kind of the planet .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it is the largest and fa@@ ste@@ st-@@ growing single source of carbon in canada , and it is also a reason why canada is now number three in terms of producing carbon per person .
and as a parent , i just can &apos;t imagine what that does to your soul .
in doing so , we &apos;ll be re@@ moving a large part of our greatest carbon sin@@ k and re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ing it with the most high greenhouse gas em@@ is@@ sion oil in the future .
the central mo@@ ti@@ f of b@@ har@@ t@@ i &apos;s practice is the re@@ ad@@ y-@@ made st@@ or@@ e-@@ bought b@@ in@@ d@@ i that un@@ told millions of indian women apply to their fore@@ heads , every day , in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage .
ra@@ q@@ i@@ b sha@@ w is k@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a-@@ born , k@@ as@@ h@@ mi@@ r@@ -@@ raised , and lon@@ d@@ on-@@ trained .
so , i hope to convince you that complex doesn &apos;t always equal complicated .
the ci@@ r@@ cl@@ ed no@@ de is the one we &apos;re trying to influence -- popular support for the government .
for example , in my first te@@ d@@ talk , i did pro@@ pos@@ e that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games .
just 30 minutes of online game play a day was enough to create dramatic bo@@ o@@ sts in mo@@ o@@ d and long-term increases in happiness .
now , why a game ?
i mean , how could a game so tri@@ vi@@ al inter@@ ven@@ e so po@@ w@@ er@@ fully in such serious , and in some cases li@@ fe@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ death , circumstances ?
there are four kinds of strength , or res@@ i@@ li@@ ence , that con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to post-@@ tr@@ au@@ matic growth , and there are s@@ ci@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ cally v@@ ali@@ d@@ ated activities that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of res@@ i@@ li@@ ence , and you don &apos;t need a tr@@ au@@ ma to do it .
it gets stronger the more you exercise it .
here &apos;s one more secret for you : sha@@ king someone &apos;s hand for six seconds dramatically ra@@ is@@ es the level of o@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in in your b@@ lo@@ o@@ d@@ stream , now that &apos;s the trust h@@ or@@ m@@ one .
and it &apos;s a project that we &apos;ve actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world , who are doing it with us . indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project , in many of its different as@@ pe@@ cts .
and then some people in chicago came along and they said , &quot; in late 2007 , the theme of the chicago hu@@ man@@ i@@ ties fe@@ sti@@ val is global warming . and we &apos;ve got this 3,000 squ@@ ar@@ e-@@ foot g@@ al@@ l@@ er@@ y and we want you to fill it with your reef . &quot;
wo@@ ol@@ en@@ ness and w@@ et@@ ness aren &apos;t exactly two concepts that go together .
and eu@@ cli@@ d said , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ?
in@@ fin@@ ity . you all got it right . exactly .
so here , in wo@@ ol , through a domestic fe@@ min@@ ine art , is the proof that the most famous po@@ stu@@ late in mathematics is wrong .
and their individual v@@ is@@ i@@ ons , and their en@@ ga@@ ge@@ ment with this mathematical mode .
and this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar re@@ cur@@ sive quality that we call self-@@ awareness , which i think is the h@@ ol@@ y gra@@ il of neuroscience , of neuro@@ lo@@ gy , and hopefully , someday , we &apos;ll understand how that happens .
why would somebody -- and this person is perfectly lu@@ ci@@ d and intelligent in all other res@@ pe@@ cts , but when he sees his mother , his del@@ u@@ sion ki@@ cks in and says , it &apos;s not mother .
now , when that area &apos;s da@@ ma@@ ged , you lose the ability to see faces , right ?
t@@ ab@@ les and ch@@ a@@ ir@@ s and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in normal people , but when you show him a picture of his mother , the g@@ al@@ van@@ ic skin response is flat .
he knows that the arm is not there , but , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , it &apos;s a comp@@ ell@@ ing sensory experience for the patient .
maybe you can re@@ li@@ e@@ ve the ph@@ an@@ tom pain , the ph@@ an@@ tom cra@@ m@@ p .
and my pain is being re@@ li@@ e@@ ved . &quot; ok ?
he said , &quot; no , last three days , i &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom arm and therefore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ bo@@ w pain , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ tom for@@ ear@@ m pain , all those pa@@ ins are gone away .
c sharp is blue , f sharp is green , another t@@ one might be yellow , right ?
that gives you the c@@ lu@@ e .
which one is ki@@ k@@ i and which one is bu@@ b@@ a ?
their sexual behavior is too hu@@ man@@ -like for most of us to be comfortable with .
this is k@@ an@@ z@@ i .
none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained .
good job .
he has learned that by using both hands and a@@ im@@ ing his gl@@ an@@ cing b@@ lo@@ ws , he can make much larger , sh@@ ar@@ per fla@@ kes .
&quot; a frame &quot; represents a hu@@ t in the wo@@ o@@ ds .
is he looking for where the sound came from ?
because we believe that it &apos;s not biology ; it &apos;s culture .
and some stars die spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in a super@@ no@@ va explo@@ sion , leaving re@@ m@@ n@@ an@@ ts like that .
on the right hand side , gravity holds s@@ way . einstein explained that .
and more than that , it &apos;s en@@ gen@@ der@@ ing new kinds of change .
he was pre@@ ma@@ ture . but he was a moral comp@@ as@@ s -- an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control .
but let &apos;s suppose some ali@@ ens had been watching our p@@ al@@ e blue dot in the co@@ smo@@ s from af@@ ar , not just for 40 years , but for the entire 4@@ .@@ 5 b@@ il@@ li@@ on-@@ year history of our earth .
martin re@@ es : is this our final century ?
this is even worse now : &quot; then i &apos;d have a picture taken and do@@ z@@ ens of g@@ lo@@ s@@ si@@ es made .
well these are college under@@ gra@@ ds , so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like ear@@ r@@ ings and ma@@ ke@@ up .
and then we asked them how happy they are again .
but en@@ or@@ m@@ ously different mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tions here .
so these are sales teams in bel@@ gi@@ um .
the teams that we give the money to spend on each other , they become different teams and , in fact , they d@@ om@@ in@@ ate the le@@ a@@ gue by the time they &apos;re done .
today , when we hear the th@@ re@@ ats of war and the high r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ic , we &apos;re o@@ f@@ ten@@ times led to believe that this is yet another one of those uns@@ ol@@ vable middle eastern conflicts with roots as old as the region itself .
ir@@ on@@ ically , this was happening at a time when iran was more interested in pe@@ ac@@ e@@ making with washington than to see to israel &apos;s destruction .
this is an an@@ al@@ o@@ gy that is de@@ li@@ ber@@ at@@ ely a@@ im@@ ed at e@@ li@@ min@@ ating di@@ p@@ lo@@ ma@@ cy , and when you e@@ li@@ min@@ ate di@@ p@@ lo@@ ma@@ cy , you make war ine@@ vi@@ table .
you can bur@@ row down by a particular type of spending , or you can go through all the different regions and compare them .
the map of por@@ t au@@ -@@ pr@@ in@@ ce at the end of 2009 was not all it could be , not as good as the map of california .
and here &apos;s the trick .
then to cl@@ ari@@ fy , she went on , &quot; he was not an en@@ vi@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ ent@@ al@@ ist . &quot;
this is a system that &apos;s designed to save the status qu@@ o , including the status qu@@ o of big and inv@@ as@@ i@@ ve government .
so it &apos;s not that mine is the most important issue . it &apos;s not .
there &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;
la@@ w@@ r@@ ence l@@ es@@ si@@ g : we the people , and the re@@ public we must re@@ claim
for example , some in this room went to school on s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship because of sp@@ u@@ t@@ ni@@ k .
at least that &apos;s what it says on my pen . &quot;
everyone is just a little bit mad .
i mean , i &apos;m not saying the law of ent@@ ro@@ p@@ y is wrong -- it &apos;s not .
here on the model you see the pre@@ d@@ at@@ or at@@ t@@ ac@@ king .
if you see fire@@ flies in north america , like so many north american sorts of things , they tend to be independent op@@ er@@ ators . they ignore each other .
every beat of your heart depends on this cru@@ ci@@ al region , the sin@@ o@@ at@@ ri@@ al no@@ de , which has about 10,000 independent cells that would each be@@ ep , have an electrical r@@ hy@@ th@@ m -- a v@@ ol@@ ta@@ ge up and down -- to send a signal to the v@@ ent@@ ri@@ c@@ les to pump .
they were in sy@@ n@@ c for a while , but then they dri@@ f@@ ted apart .
so i want to first show you some inter@@ vi@@ e@@ ws with people who were on the bridge on opening day , who will describe what happened .
now , you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a me@@ tr@@ on@@ om@@ e , but after all , we do walk like -- i mean , we o@@ sc@@ il@@ late back and forth as we walk .
am : this one &apos;s only a couple of tons , so it &apos;s fairly easy to get going .
he was the most res@@ pe@@ cted scientist in the field .
i wouldn &apos;t tell them what it was , but it was in al@@ p@@ h@@ ab@@ e@@ tic@@ al order , and i would tell them to look for their names , their family names , their mother &apos;s ma@@ i@@ den name .
the other thing is that maybe that fo@@ w@@ ler apple or maybe a variety of wh@@ e@@ at that &apos;s not e@@ con@@ om@@ ical right now has disease or p@@ est resistance or some quality that we &apos;re going to need for climate change that the others don &apos;t .
we will watch children star@@ ve to death on tv .
the idea of s@@ val@@ b@@ ard was that it &apos;s cold , so we get natural fre@@ e@@ zing te@@ m@@ per@@ at@@ ur@@ es .
and if anything happens , then they can come back and get it .
thank you .
you should care about your post@@ ure -- this is not right .
any lady , any lady ? thank you very much .
there &apos;s only been two concepts tried -- two by the u.s. and one by the r@@ us@@ si@@ ans .
talk very b@@ ri@@ e@@ fly about innovation cy@@ c@@ les , things that grow , have a lot of activity ; they die out when they &apos;re re@@ placed by something else .
i can &apos;t tell you when this will start , because i don &apos;t want my competition to know my s@@ ch@@ e@@ du@@ le .
what &apos;s out there is there &apos;s something really interesting going to happen here .
ok , we &apos;ll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s so f@@ ru@@ st@@ r@@ ated he &apos;s ready to give up , but he has an e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any one day .
institutions are becoming naked , and if you &apos;re going to be naked , well , there &apos;s some cor@@ ol@@ l@@ aries that flow from that .
now , the fourth meaning of openness , and cor@@ res@@ po@@ n@@ ding principle , is about em@@ po@@ w@@ er@@ ment .
the to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ st@@ e is out of the tube .
you know , bees come in s@@ war@@ ms and fish come in schools .
there &apos;s a medical revolution happening all around us , and it &apos;s one that &apos;s going to help us con@@ qu@@ er some of society &apos;s most d@@ re@@ ad@@ ed conditions , including cancer .
this is a tumor : dark , gray , om@@ in@@ ous mass growing inside a brain .
and you can see that the hal@@ o of blood flow dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ars after treatment .
but the real question is : how well do these work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we added an extract from stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ri@@ es ; it po@@ t@@ ently in@@ hi@@ bits an@@ gi@@ o@@ gen@@ es@@ is .
but what &apos;s even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop pro@@ state cancer , those who ate more ser@@ v@@ ings of to@@ ma@@ to s@@ au@@ ce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer .
al@@ b@@ er@@ t s@@ z@@ ent@@ -@@ g@@ y@@ or@@ g@@ i once said that , &quot; discovery con@@ si@@ sts of seeing what everyone has seen , and thinking what no one has thought . &quot;
i &apos;m the puzzle col@@ um@@ n@@ ist for discover magazine .
&quot; fun to solve , &quot; as opposed to everyday problems , which , frankly , are not very well-@@ designed pu@@ zz@@ les .
the background to one is the other .
well , you can &apos;t do that physically , but on a computer you can do it . let &apos;s switch over to the p@@ .@@ c.
i wanted to make a se@@ qu@@ el .
which way will these fall ?
so , we got games like &quot; brain age &quot; coming out for the n@@ in@@ ten@@ do ds , huge hit .
looks like a black shape . so , where is that ?
i actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we &apos;ve had to train everyone not to be that .
i remember , for example , when my father , who was very , very violent , used to beat me .
we are so ac@@ cu@@ st@@ om@@ ed to ro@@ b@@ bing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually ob@@ je@@ c@@ ti@@ fied them and turned them into com@@ mo@@ di@@ ties .
and she looked into her baby &apos;s eyes and she said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ?
when we were there she was doing a ri@@ tu@@ al where she re@@ con@@ c@@ il@@ es girls , who have run away , with their families .
and i will be in your corner for the rest of your life . &quot;
i love that i do not take things li@@ gh@@ t@@ ly .
why would you want to shut me down or turn me off ?
so at the actual trial , all six of the teenagers te@@ sti@@ fied , and indi@@ cated the i@@ den@@ ti@@ fi@@ ca@@ tions they had made in the photo ar@@ ray .
but this occurred in mid-@@ january , in the northern he@@ mis@@ p@@ here , at 7 p@@ .@@ m@@ . at night .
that &apos;s 30 feet away .
and what does this example -- what &apos;s important to keep in mind for ourselves ?
he was a very religious man .
so i got a f@@ ul@@ bright s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship to just travel around africa for a year asking people why they were building fra@@ ct@@ als , which is a great job if you can get it .
and the re@@ cur@@ sion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; well , if i lived in the j@@ un@@ g@@ le , i would only use the long ro@@ ws of stra@@ w because they &apos;re very quick and they &apos;re very cheap .
so even plus odd gives you odd .
we &apos;ve started a pilot program in ghana .
now , here &apos;s the bad news .
instead of turning to friends or rel@@ a@@ ti@@ ves , they looked to david &apos;s work@@ place .
today , a@@ gi@@ le is used in a hundred countries , and it &apos;s s@@ we@@ e@@ ping into management su@@ ites .
getting over our fear of ri@@ ding bi@@ kes . making our be@@ ds .
we &apos;ll set a few rules and we &apos;ll stick to them .
the conversation will go better . &quot;
just as i was leaving to come here tonight , one of my d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters started s@@ cre@@ am@@ ing .
and we ended up with 10 stat@@ em@@ ents .
i was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er when i first read &quot; an@@ na kar@@ en@@ in@@ a &quot; and its famous opening sentence , &quot; all happy families are ali@@ ke .
i &apos;m here to show you how something you can &apos;t see can be so much fun to look at .
so if i put this inside this water here , you can see a sil@@ ver re@@ fle@@ ctive co@@ ating around it , and that sil@@ ver re@@ fle@@ ctive co@@ ating is the layer of air that &apos;s protecting the water from t@@ ou@@ ching the pa@@ d@@ d@@ le , and it &apos;s dry .
pla@@ to in the cave with those very young boys . swe@@ en@@ ey : o@@ oh ...
let me show you .
but t@@ es@@ la &apos;s success didn &apos;t last .
one of the things i want to e@@ st@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h right from the start is that not all neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons wear co@@ w@@ boy bo@@ ots .
we can turn it up or down , on or off .
so he is one of five kids .
i &apos;ve shown you that we can use it to treat a mo@@ o@@ d circuit in cases of depression .
we are now learning to understand what are the ci@@ r@@ cu@@ its , what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for the clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases .
really evolution works more like a tin@@ k@@ er@@ er than an engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human like richard , or a co@@ ck@@ ro@@ a@@ ch , or a cra@@ b , or a k@@ an@@ g@@ ar@@ o@@ o , the relative leg sti@@ ff@@ ness of that spring is the same for everything we &apos;ve seen so far .
okay . the point is it &apos;s really hard to tell , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s incredible , we looked at students do this and they couldn &apos;t tell .
it uses a pres@@ su@@ re-@@ sensitive ad@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ ve to do it .
what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re taking that inspiration of the ha@@ ir@@ s , and with another col@@ le@@ a@@ gue at ber@@ k@@ el@@ e@@ y , we &apos;re manufacturing them .
showed that , of married sen@@ i@@ or man@@ a@@ gers , two-@@ th@@ ir@@ ds of the married men had children and only one-@@ third of the married women had children .
i left san francisco , where i live , on mon@@ day , and i was getting on the plane for this conference .
and we walk out , and we look at each other , and we say , &quot; how did you do ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous harvard business school study on a woman named h@@ ei@@ d@@ i ro@@ i@@ z@@ en .
and i put my hand down , and i noticed all the women put their hand down , and then you took more questions , only from the men . &quot;
one woman came to see me about this , and i kind of looked at her -- she looked a little young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as much as they should , but they do it .
so fear showed up as not really the driver .
but it actually hits home .
so i want to talk about , i want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country , how we actually get information .
so it sp@@ ell@@ s those out in very clean terms , and that works .
we tell you that you &apos;re okay , you &apos;re normal .
so this patient is in their 5@@ 0@@ s , so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for pro@@ state cancer is .
you do not need to have the education level of people in this room .
and that bee , no doubt , as@@ su@@ m@@ ed that it had decided , &quot; i &apos;m going for that apple tree , i &apos;m going for that b@@ lo@@ s@@ so@@ m , i &apos;m going to get the ne@@ ct@@ ar and i &apos;m going to leave . &quot;
and when you &apos;re talking about nature , which is really my subject as a writer , how does it meet the al@@ do le@@ o@@ po@@ l@@ d test ?
well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
the only technology involved here is this cheap electric f@@ en@@ cing : relatively new , ho@@ o@@ ked to a car battery ; even i could carry a quar@@ ter@@ -@@ ac@@ re pa@@ d@@ do@@ ck , set it up in 15 minutes .
when a ru@@ min@@ ant gra@@ zes grass , the grass is cut from this height to this height , and it immediately does something very interesting .
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s already under construction ; it &apos;s already happening .
if you &apos;re not , too bad . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come here at a certain time , get your dr@@ in@@ ks half off .
and then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways .
and it &apos;s very powerful .
di@@ g@@ g is a com@@ m@@ un@@ al dynamic to try to find and source the best news , the most interesting stories .
we spoke to you last several years ago .
now you can also see , if i turn this around here -- hopefully i won &apos;t shake the world too much .
you can see that it got started right here .
this is one of our engineers .
men@@ de@@ l , who was supposed to be teaching high-@@ school students , actually , you know , discovered the laws of gen@@ e@@ tics -- as a ho@@ b@@ by , basically .
raise your hands .
it makes it a really fun place to work .
and so that &apos;s something we work on , and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now , and that &apos;s really their goal .
so thank you .
now , what br@@ un@@ el said that he wanted to achieve for his p@@ as@@ sen@@ gers was the experience of floating across the co@@ un@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
what makes life easier , more en@@ jo@@ y@@ able ?
par@@ t@@ ly they did this by instead of building a f@@ an@@ cy new factory , they used the bas@@ em@@ ent of one of their hospitals .
now the industrial systems of br@@ un@@ el &apos;s time have run their course , and indeed they are part of the problem today .
and just like br@@ un@@ el , by focusing on systems , we can have a bigger impact .
surprised by my in@@ si@@ st@@ ence , the wa@@ it@@ er took up the issue with the man@@ ag@@ er .
mark le@@ p@@ p@@ er and i did a series of studies in which we s@@ ou@@ g@@ h@@ t the answer to this very question .
yet that is exactly what the american paradigm de@@ m@@ and@@ s .
but for eastern eu@@ ro@@ pe@@ ans , the sudden a@@ va@@ il@@ ability of all these consumer products on the mar@@ k@@ et@@ place was a del@@ u@@ ge .
americans themselves are dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ing that un@@ limited choice seems more at@@ tra@@ ctive in theory than in practice .
french parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; no@@ ah was here for so little time , but he taught us so much .
robert f@@ ro@@ st once said that , &quot; it is poetry that is lost in trans@@ lation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very el@@ e@@ g@@ an@@ t sha@@ de of p@@ ink . &quot;
well , the three big problems have in common that they are man@@ -@@ made problems but they are controlled by natural forces .
so — thank you very much .
it &apos;s to replace competition by collaboration .
then what we want to do is create si@@ x@@ -@@ meter ver@@ sions so we can test the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um performance of these machines , so we can go at very , very high speed .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that actually the tech world is best understood , not as a business cycle , but as a m@@ es@@ si@@ an@@ ic movement .
enter the at@@ om@@ ic bomb .
and then , the 9@@ 2 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .
then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set , and ru@@ b it out from the center to the cor@@ ners , like this .
if you sub@@ st@@ it@@ ute the word b@@ lo@@ go@@ sphere , of the internet today , it is very true that his understanding is probably very en@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing now . let &apos;s listen in to him .
i think it was that interaction that led to personal computing .
ph : i hope you realize how sub@@ ver@@ sive that is .
eventually , the race to the future took on added m@@ om@@ ent@@ um with the bre@@ a@@ k@@ up of the telephone company .
m@@ m : because it gave the audience a role , something to do .
they &apos;re producing things for between 1,@@ 500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and whereas television may have gotten beat up , what &apos;s getting built is a really exciting new form of communication , and we kind of have the mer@@ ger of the two in@@ du@@ stri@@ es and a new way of thinking to look at it .
he &apos;s a sp@@ an@@ ish architect and designer .
color can an@@ i@@ ma@@ te simple blocks , simple materials : walking in new york , i &apos;ll stop .
it gave me possibilities for wonder -- if maybe it &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we could all agree , and create some in@@ st@@ al@@ la@@ tions .
but the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant , and almost an international model .
even the parts of the airplane had french names .
and he said , &quot; well for one thing , there are more girls there . &quot;
and that &apos;s the way , ultimately after some u@@ ps and do@@ w@@ ns , i ended up designing the chair i &apos;m going to show you .
he said she had one of the new , better ch@@ a@@ ir@@ s .
or you can pull them up where you want them .
but then i knew from experience and looking around in o@@ ff@@ ic@@ es where there were ch@@ a@@ ir@@ s with head@@ re@@ sts that nobody would ever bo@@ ther to reach back and turn a k@@ no@@ b and ad@@ just the head@@ rest to put it in position .
and den@@ gue fe@@ ver has grown in speed quite ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ ally .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember which , i saw a re@@ u@@ ters report that said ma@@ d@@ ei@@ ra had had their first cases of den@@ gue , about 5@@ 2 cases , with about 400 pro@@ b@@ able cases .
we want something that gets that population right the way down so it can &apos;t get the disease trans@@ mission .
so here &apos;s a typical situation , male me@@ ets female , lots of o@@ ff@@ spring .
so f@@ r@@ ei@@ g@@ h@@ t costs aren &apos;t our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; &quot; why here ? &quot;
and i don &apos;t w@@ an@@ der far from that place for a majority of my time , even though i &apos;m an ex@@ ten@@ sive global tre@@ k@@ ker .
look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
so , our cell phones can now build a place history .
bill da@@ ven@@ hall : your health depends on where you live
that is my grandfather .
for the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it .
as i explained earlier , plants extract p@@ ho@@ sp@@ h@@ or@@ us from the soil , through water .
this is the cover of an extraordinary article published in nature in 2009 , which really launched the discussion about the p@@ ho@@ sp@@ h@@ or@@ us crisis .
remember that 80 percent is de@@ st@@ ined to be lost .
and instead of using a 100 percent do@@ se , i &apos;m going to reduce it to 25 percent .
we have a technology that works , and one that , if used cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ly , will al@@ le@@ vi@@ ate some of the pressure we are putting on the world &apos;s p@@ ho@@ sp@@ h@@ or@@ us res@@ er@@ ves .
and he was what you &apos;d call a ter@@ at@@ ologist : he looked at all of the mon@@ st@@ ro@@ si@@ ties and mu@@ tations to find rules and laws , rather than looking at the nor@@ ms .
and in this example , you can see that the components of this sta@@ i@@ r are re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive , but they &apos;re re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive without being mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ar .
now , as an architect , par@@ t@@ -@@ to-@@ whole relationships is all i think about , but in terms of product design it &apos;s becoming more and more of an issue for companies .
we really ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ed it at the level of the t@@ y@@ po@@ lo@@ gy of the building , where we could build these five separate to@@ w@@ er@@ s , but they would all join at the 6@@ 0@@ th floor and make a kind of single mon@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic mass .
let &apos;s come back again a few years later , here in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that that landscape actually looks a lot more like i@@ o@@ w@@ a than it does like a ra@@ in@@ forest .
the difference is mainly ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ating the desert for food , or maybe golf c@@ ou@@ r@@ ses in sc@@ ot@@ t@@ s@@ d@@ al@@ e , you take your pick .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were du@@ m@@ p@@ ed there that are now becoming air@@ bor@@ ne .
we &apos;ve d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed the flo@@ ws of ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en and p@@ ho@@ sp@@ h@@ or@@ us around the world simply by using fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ ers , causing huge problems of water quality from ri@@ vers , la@@ kes , and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the single biggest driver of bio@@ diversity loss .
but we can do this , and there are opportunities to make this work .
ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ation is the biggest use of water on the planet .
must work together .
so , what am i talking about when i talk about system d ?
we want our products in that store . &quot;
all of system d really doesn &apos;t pay ta@@ x@@ es , right ?
and we interact with the physical world with our hands .
what do you do ?
we &apos;re using a biological am@@ p@@ li@@ fi@@ er to am@@ p@@ li@@ fy these n@@ er@@ ve signals -- muscles .
and this is what it looks like .
and here we d@@ e@@ in@@ n@@ er@@ v@@ ate , or cut the n@@ er@@ ve away , just from little se@@ g@@ ments of muscle and leave others alone that give us our up@@ -@@ down signals and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put in an electro@@ de and say , &quot; go there . &quot;
and that &apos;s where our goal is -- to have something c@@ lin@@ ically pra@@ g@@ matic to wear .
this is j@@ es@@ se , and he &apos;s squ@@ e@@ e@@ zing a fo@@ am to@@ y .
so thank you very much .
sub-@@ sa@@ har@@ an africa largely f@@ its this des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion , with 22 million people living with hiv , an e@@ sti@@ ma@@ ted 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected worldwide .
local governments need to set up effective systems for re@@ vi@@ e@@ wing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are au@@ th@@ ori@@ zed in different developing countries , ethical review com@@ mit@@ te@@ es that are independent of the government and research s@@ po@@ n@@ s@@ ors .
so the fundamental problems that we face are over@@ consumption and too many people .
so they have all the cri@@ ter@@ i@@ a that people normally like .
and so you can see this current coming up -- in this case , the hum@@ b@@ ol@@ d@@ t current -- that comes all the way out to the g@@ al@@ a@@ pa@@ go@@ s islands , and this deep under@@ sea current , the cro@@ m@@ well current , that up@@ w@@ ell@@ s around the g@@ al@@ a@@ pa@@ go@@ s .
and also , we know that it &apos;s not only g@@ al@@ a@@ pa@@ go@@ s penguins that are in trouble , but ma@@ g@@ ell@@ an@@ ics and many other species of penguins .
so now i want to show you that penguins are affected .
tur@@ b@@ o has taken to k@@ no@@ cking on the door with his be@@ ak , we let him in and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another fellow that will l@@ ei@@ surely come by .
well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved : our basic political geo@@ graphy .
and they share a l@@ en@@ g@@ th@@ y land border .
again , like mon@@ go@@ li@@ a , china isn &apos;t con@@ qu@@ ering russia . it &apos;s just le@@ as@@ ing it .
for po@@ or@@ er countries , china re@@ du@@ ces t@@ ari@@ ff@@ s so that la@@ os and cam@@ bo@@ di@@ a can sell their goods more che@@ ap@@ ly and become dependent on ex@@ por@@ ting to china as well .
what i want to present to you is what i call state building , day by day .
these two ar@@ ro@@ ws are an ar@@ c , an ar@@ c of com@@ mu@@ ter ra@@ il@@ roads and other infrastructure that link the west bank and ga@@ z@@ a .
a great deal of them .
so what is next ? what is the future of the european union ?
5@@ 3 countries , and by far the most number of s@@ us@@ pi@@ ci@@ ously straight lines on the map .
this is a dream of the ages .
is it mis@@ er@@ able ? it doesn &apos;t seem to be .
okay .
and the h@@ or@@ m@@ one ig@@ f@@ -@@ 1 pro@@ m@@ ot@@ es growth .
so how can a h@@ or@@ m@@ one ultimately affect the rate of aging ?
well we think that in@@ su@@ li@@ n and ig@@ f@@ -@@ 1 h@@ or@@ mon@@ es are h@@ or@@ mon@@ es that are particularly active under fa@@ v@@ or@@ able conditions -- in the good times -- when food is pl@@ en@@ ti@@ ful and there &apos;s not a lot of stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details of how this works , but we do know then that fo@@ x@@ o genes can impact the li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an of people .
you could change the genes in principle .
so it could be that the pa@@ th@@ ways that i &apos;ve been talking about , which are set to run really quickly in the wor@@ m , have a different normal set point in something like a bird , so that a bird can live a lot longer .
you &apos;ll never see an ad like that because ni@@ ke actually wants you to buy their shoes .
they all have heroes who were chosen .
it &apos;s like trying to run into a bri@@ ck wall .
this view is con@@ di@@ ti@@ on@@ ed by the fact that many of the drugs that are pres@@ cri@@ bed to treat these disorders , like pro@@ z@@ a@@ c , act by globally changing brain chemistry , as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical s@@ ou@@ p .
and my e@@ po@@ n@@ y@@ m@@ ous col@@ le@@ a@@ gue , se@@ y@@ m@@ our ben@@ z@@ er , believed it as well .
so doing the screen , we discovered one mu@@ t@@ ant that took much longer than normal to cal@@ m down after the air pu@@ ff@@ s , and when we ex@@ am@@ ined the gene that was affected in this mu@@ tation , it turned out to en@@ code a d@@ op@@ am@@ ine re@@ ce@@ p@@ t@@ or .
now people have been wondering about this for a long time in humans , but in flies we can actually test this .
either way , mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os find us in the dark by s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing us out . they smell us .
that &apos;s the che@@ ese , just to show you .
in fact , people have told me that now they will enjoy being b@@ it@@ ten by mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
in the following year .
and at each time , i would feel the ch@@ il@@ ling star@@ es of con@@ de@@ m@@ ned pris@@ on@@ ers &apos; eyes follow me .
and as it turns out , fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .
as we speak , there are 1@@ 17 or so clinical trials res@@ ear@@ ching the use of stem cells for liver diseases .
we are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this an@@ ge@@ l in the world -- not only in our country , ven@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ a , but in our world .
so what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ?
but here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
i can &apos;t tell you anymore about that one because i stopped reading it at the head@@ line .
j@@ en@@ na mc@@ car@@ th@@ y : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it gets even better , for it turns out that we can f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ate the re@@ c@@ ei@@ vers out of materials that are en@@ co@@ ded in dna .
the animal j@@ um@@ ps , it sp@@ re@@ ads its w@@ ings , it vi@@ br@@ ates them , but it can &apos;t actually take off because the fly is s@@ and@@ wi@@ ched between two glass pl@@ ates .
now for an intelligent being like our fly , this policy is not written in stone but rather changes as the animal le@@ ar@@ ns from experience .
through many such experiments , we were able to nar@@ row down the identity of the cri@@ tic to just 12 cells .
there are some ideas in computer science and in artificial intelligence as to how this might be done , but we still haven &apos;t solved a single example of how intelligent behavior sp@@ r@@ ings from the physical interactions in living matter .
this is li@@ b@@ by , or actually , this is an ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ un@@ d image of li@@ b@@ by .
ed : all ri@@ gh@@ t@@ .@@ t@@ b : okay . turn it a little bit inside , a little bit toward the middle for me .
now i personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age .
and this is a picture of my gra@@ du@@ ation team from legacy .
and i tell you , this kind of care cu@@ st@@ om@@ i@@ zation for everything from your goals to your gen@@ e@@ tics will be the most gam@@ e-@@ changing transformation that we wi@@ t@@ ness in health care during our lifetime .
they don &apos;t stick by v@@ el@@ cr@@ o or su@@ ction or gl@@ u@@ e .
here is the actual robot .
mar@@ c ra@@ i@@ b@@ er@@ t built a uni@@ ro@@ o h@@ op@@ ping robot .
and what would happen if they cli@@ m@@ bed on the under@@ side of that le@@ a@@ f , and there was some wind , or we sho@@ ok it ?
so we did . and here is what it does .
completely opposite of the way you &apos;d see it on a nature film , of course .
we &apos;ll look at sea level rise .
and i would say , for the people that work in the ocean and think about what the t@@ ar@@ gets should be , we would argue that they must be much lower .
this is the ship that i spent the last three months on in the ant@@ arctic .
when that ice m@@ el@@ ts , sea level ris@@ es by six meters .
what caused it ?
either case , it &apos;s bad news for the cor@@ als of the g@@ al@@ a@@ pa@@ go@@ s islands .
their ra@@ ti@@ o tells us the water temperature .
but then at the very end is where we have the in@@ st@@ ru@@ mental record in black .
so we figured out some pretty interesting ways to track co2 levels in the atmosphere , we used to do it just with ice cor@@ es , but in this case , we &apos;re going back 20 million years .
and that is a task to which einstein set himself -- to figure out how gravity works .
einstein had already used up space and time , war@@ ps and cur@@ ves , to describe gravity .
but deeply tu@@ cked into the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of space itself , the idea is there could be more dimensions , as we see there .
and just like the vi@@ br@@ ating st@@ r@@ ings that you just saw in a c@@ ell@@ o can vi@@ bra@@ te in different patterns , these can also vi@@ bra@@ te in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some pre@@ vi@@ ously un@@ explained features of the world , or can we actually test for these extra dimensions ?
so , we have two pan@@ els here , of col@@ or@@ ed dots .
now , can any of you see the pre@@ d@@ at@@ or that &apos;s about to jump out at you ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is true for information generally .
and we &apos;re going to look at that for about 30 seconds , which is a bit of a killer in an 18@@ -@@ minute talk .
why ? because if the ti@@ le in that sha@@ do@@ w were in fact in sha@@ do@@ w , and re@@ fle@@ cting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the sha@@ do@@ w , it would have to be more re@@ fle@@ ctive -- just the laws of physics .
how do you know ?
and she &apos;ll come into the hi@@ ve , find an empty h@@ on@@ ey po@@ t and throw up , and that &apos;s h@@ on@@ ey .
he finds it . amazing . right ?
agreed ? yes ?
now there &apos;s often no right or wrong here .
2010 new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of st@@ or@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ers .
well a couple of things : understanding of the security , of the risks , the th@@ re@@ ats , the counter@@ me@@ as@@ ur@@ es , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , you need models to understand a lot of the risks we face .
think of cancer , of bird flu , sw@@ ine flu , s@@ ars .
there was no new data , but there was less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias i &apos;ll call con@@ fi@@ r@@ ma@@ tion bias , where we tend to accept data that con@@ fi@@ r@@ ms our be@@ li@@ e@@ f@@ s and re@@ je@@ ct data that con@@ tra@@ di@@ cts our be@@ li@@ e@@ f@@ s .
i re@@ li@@ ed on some other group to determine whether my plane was safe to fly .
this ter@@ ri@@ fied people .
and it was found close to here , stanford .
they had good relationships with the teachers , students .
let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice . &quot;
and i as@@ su@@ m@@ ed someone was working to preserve it or save it and i could v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er , but i realized no one was doing anything .
we opened the f@@ ist section in 2009 .
robert ham@@ mon@@ d : building a park in the sky
and groups are very often immediately l@@ ab@@ el ter@@ r@@ ori@@ sts .
they need an in@@ c@@ lu@@ sive process where the real f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of this very complicated society can deal with their issues .
the point is that we are probably seeing , for the first time in the history of the arab world , a revolution bot@@ t@@ om@@ -up -- people &apos;s revolution .
and the par@@ a@@ do@@ x is that the decade before the last decade was so pro@@ mis@@ ing -- and for one reason pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly .
all of a sudden , n@@ go@@ s were not only standing in the streets , crying their s@@ lo@@ g@@ an@@ s , but they were taking &#91; them &#93; into the ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations , par@@ t@@ ly because they represented the victims of these weapons .
thank you for your attention .
but i &apos;m not thinking &quot; mon@@ st@@ er@@ et &quot; is a good thing .
so , this used to be completely smooth .
now , it &apos;s kind of nu@@ ts to work on a new nuclear re@@ actor .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know that cre@@ e@@ p@@ y rich guy in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big to@@ ot@@ h . &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the or@@ c@@ as come , they &apos;re right by the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i admit that i &apos;m a little bit nervous here because i &apos;m going to say some radical things , about how we should think about cancer differently , to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than i do .
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
there &apos;s a huge amount of information about the gen@@ e@@ tics just by com@@ par@@ ing the genetic si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ity .
so i was like , &quot; okay . this guy &apos;s at least res@@ ou@@ r@@ ce@@ ful . &quot;
so we &apos;re actually measuring each is@@ ot@@ op@@ e as a different one .
if you &apos;ve got malaria , we give you qu@@ in@@ ine or some der@@ i@@ va@@ tive of it .
what we really need to get at is the process that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s happening at the level of the prote@@ on@@ om@@ ic actions , happening at the level of why is your body not he@@ al@@ ing itself in the way that it normally does ?
dan@@ ny h@@ il@@ li@@ s : understanding cancer through prote@@ om@@ ics
all of you are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to simply write people off .
because it is in stage three that many of us move .
this is their lo@@ b@@ by .
there was no road map . no one had ever done anything like this before .
in fact , martin lu@@ ther king &apos;s most famous line was at stage three .
so i &apos;m going to sit here in my chair and not do anything . &quot;
and suddenly they pulled out she@@ ets of paper and were trying to figure out , &quot; how do we survey the population of sub-@@ sa@@ har@@ an africa ?
we automatically throw the little nu@@ b of plastic up@@ ward .
these one or two story structures , designed to y@@ i@@ el@@ d only enough income to cover the ta@@ x@@ es on the land on which they stand , were not meant to be permanent buildings .
they understand the st@@ ru@@ c@@ tu@@ ra@@ l in@@ te@@ gri@@ ty of a deep a@@ v@@ un@@ cul@@ ar la@@ p , as compared to the sha@@ ky ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge@@ ment of a neuro@@ tic ni@@ e@@ ce in high he@@ els .
but compassion , from my van@@ ta@@ ge point , has a problem .
and it is a most edi@@ fying form of in@@ st@@ ant gra@@ ti@@ fication .
i can &apos;t quite explain it , and he can &apos;t either .
stories like this , signs like this , are practical tools in a world lon@@ ging to bring compassion to ab@@ und@@ ant images of suffering that can otherwise over@@ wh@@ el@@ m us .
g@@ and@@ hi , too , was a real fla@@ wed human being .
and on the very first day our co@@ un@@ s@@ el@@ or ga@@ ther@@ ed us all together and she taught us a che@@ er that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to in@@ still camp spirit .
so that &apos;s one out of every two or three people you know .
i &apos;ll give you some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t even be in a group of people without in@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tively mi@@ r@@ r@@ or@@ ing , mi@@ mi@@ cking their op@@ in@@ i@@ ons .
so that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
and so these days i try to learn from my grandfather &apos;s example in my own way .
okay , number two : go to the wil@@ der@@ ness .
and , as you can imagine , if you can picture this : i was born in a very small village in mexico , in , unfortunately , very poor sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ings , and my parents did not have a college education .
and so , we believe that through all the changes that have occurred , that we &apos;re faced today with a tremendous opportunity .
it is an in@@ i@@ ti@@ ative that is focused on simple , accessible and hu@@ man@@ -@@ c@@ ent@@ ri@@ c solutions .
we have now de@@ p@@ lo@@ yed 30 different te@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ gi@@ sts in 18 different countries , and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular se@@ g@@ ment of the market needs and de@@ m@@ and@@ s .
and on my we@@ d@@ ding day , my father came to me again and said , &quot; you know , i &apos;m going to remind you again , that each generation has to do better than the last one .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &quot; but why can &apos;t i figure out my problems ? &quot;
i started it with one other family in 19@@ 80 .
do you think we have a ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship here , to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still drive the same f@@ ou@@ r@@ -year-old ford that i &apos;ve driven .
but that &apos;s not the good life .
that &apos;s what he pra@@ ys .
whether you believe it &apos;s true or not -- it really didn &apos;t matter to me .
so , he &apos;s going , &quot; what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
so , what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball , and that bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball represents your identity , who you are .
when my little kids were little -- they &apos;re all grown , now i have grand@@ kids -- i used to go in and sit on the side of their bed , and i used to watch my kids sleep .
that &apos;s smaller than i pre@@ di@@ cted -- i pre@@ di@@ cted three to 10 million -- but is still a very large number .
in a village , you have 100 la@@ p@@ t@@ op@@ s , each with a different set of 100 books , and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for p@@ ic@@ ni@@ c area .
you guys are an@@ s@@ w@@ er@@ ing the question : how does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
we learn these really bad lessons really well .
think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
and unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing an incredibly n@@ er@@ dy book about a subject everybody hat@@ es for an audience that would never ma@@ ter@@ i@@ alize .
the effect of this , of course , is it &apos;s not just am@@ ber waves of grain , it is mountains of stuff .
she came to this country in 19@@ 8@@ 6 from vi@@ et@@ na@@ m .
and i &apos;d get a ter@@ se response : &quot; oh , that &apos;s worse . &quot;
our em@@ p@@ lo@@ ye@@ e tur@@ no@@ ver dropped to one-@@ third of the industry average , and during that five year d@@ ot@@ co@@ m b@@ us@@ t , we tri@@ pl@@ ed in size .
b@@ hu@@ tan , for those of you who don &apos;t know it , is the ne@@ west democracy in the world , just two years ago .
the reality is , in western countries , quite often we do focus on the pur@@ suit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out -- an object that we &apos;re supposed to get , or maybe many objects .
we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
b@@ l : all right . one , two , three .
right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner ears are you telling you you &apos;re moving . your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in re@@ gi@@ ster with the boat , say i &apos;m standing still .
so am@@ y , would you please come up ?
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
and i &apos;ll just read one .
now , true science education i think should be about giving people a voice and en@@ ab@@ ling to express that voice , so i &apos;ve asked am@@ y to be the last voice in this short story .
other people who are poor don &apos;t have those choices .
we &apos;re back where we were in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s .
and the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of dis@@ pos@@ ability not only h@@ ur@@ ts the species we &apos;ve talked about , but it even cor@@ ru@@ p@@ ts our own society .
now , 60 years later , i &apos;m here to tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure any of you have asked the question , yeah , are there great things up there -- what am i going to do , get up there ?
i was a professor at the u@@ .@@ c. da@@ v@@ is system , and i got a lot of ex@@ c@@ it@@ em@@ ent around this , and i was able to fund the in@@ i@@ ti@@ ation of the program back in that time .
we have eight en@@ g@@ ines in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they dis@@ in@@ te@@ gra@@ te , and they end up here .
i mean , people are worried about c@@ ell@@ phones being safe .
you &apos;ve got a co@@ il .
because remember dr. sol@@ j@@ ac@@ ic &apos;s original idea was his wife &apos;s c@@ ell@@ phone be@@ e@@ p@@ ing .
and for those of you who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; it does appear to be some kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural bu@@ ri@@ als , which don &apos;t use em@@ bal@@ m@@ ing , are a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t address the existing to@@ x@@ ins in our bodies .
first , a bu@@ ri@@ al suit in@@ f@@ used with m@@ us@@ h@@ room s@@ por@@ es , the m@@ us@@ h@@ room death suit .
only months later , i discover who he really was .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; keep him alive if you can . &quot;
even with that c@@ le@@ ar@@ -@@ cut paper in our hands , we just kept re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing hope .
it &apos;s a feature .
and suddenly he knows he &apos;s been de@@ fe@@ ated .
in order to do that , we have to put you as a user back in the driver &apos;s seat .
we flew the area . we i@@ ma@@ ged it . we sent in people . we took pictures of inter@@ i@@ ors , disaster areas . we helped with the first res@@ po@@ n@@ ders , the search and rescue .
by doing this i don &apos;t lose the original detail . in fact , i might be recording history .
you &apos;re being con@@ stra@@ ined by the public &apos;s opinion .
that &apos;s not too good .
and which one is a democracy ? &quot;
the question there is : which country did better , china or india ?
because , as an indian man , you have about two years of life ex@@ pe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy advantage vis@@ -@@ a-@@ v@@ is indian women .
in terms of the political changes , they have introduced village el@@ e@@ c@@ tions .
china , i believe , still has some of the excellent raw f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ als -- mostly the social capital , the public health , the sense of e@@ g@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism that you don &apos;t find in india .
it was a space where people would get together from different back@@ gro@@ un@@ ds , different fields of ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se , and share .
and so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries , and then it ends up being us@@ eless .
this is the kind of ch@@ a@@ o@@ tic environment where ideas were likely to come together , where people were likely to have new , interesting , un@@ pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able col@@ li@@ sions -- people from different back@@ gro@@ un@@ ds .
about a decade or two ago , a wonderful s@@ ch@@ ol@@ ar named ho@@ ward gr@@ u@@ ber went back and looked at darwin &apos;s not@@ e@@ books from this period .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; no , i hadn &apos;t thought of doing that .
could you go the other way ?
in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s , the one percent ac@@ co@@ un@@ ted for about 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
a lot of these political factors can be bro@@ ad@@ ly l@@ um@@ ped under the cat@@ e@@ g@@ ory of &quot; cr@@ on@@ y capitalism , &quot; political changes that benefit a group of well-@@ connected in@@ si@@ ders but don &apos;t actually do much good for the rest of us .
but while it &apos;s pretty easy to see how globalization and the technology revolution are creating this global pl@@ u@@ to@@ cra@@ cy , what &apos;s a lot harder is figuring out what to think about it .
that &apos;s why they are spending un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ent@@ ed time and resources e@@ du@@ c@@ ating their own children .
we created the modern w@@ el@@ f@@ are state .
his is the little hand .
so one of these will happen to all of us .
so that was really kind of he@@ ar@@ t@@ breaking for us , because we thought this was going to really take off .
i actually think that , in places like or@@ e@@ g@@ on , where you can have ph@@ y@@ si@@ ci@@ an@@ -@@ as@@ si@@ sted suicide , you take a po@@ is@@ on@@ ous do@@ se of stuff , only half a percent of people ever do that .
so , to make a long story short , they came to canada .
but i &apos;d heard of cancer as the most fe@@ ar@@ ed disease of our time , so how did the good and bad go together ?
some ar@@ tic@@ les even went as far as to say that sk@@ el@@ et@@ al muscle tissue is resi@@ st@@ ant to cancer , and f@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , not only to cancer , but of me@@ ta@@ st@@ ases going to sk@@ el@@ et@@ al muscle .
16 percent ! meaning that there were these pin@@ point tumors in sk@@ el@@ et@@ al muscle , but only .@@ 16 percent of actual me@@ ta@@ st@@ ases -- suggesting that maybe sk@@ el@@ et@@ al muscle is able to control the an@@ gi@@ o@@ gen@@ es@@ is , is able to control the tumors re@@ cru@@ it@@ ing these blood vessels .
that &apos;s a very far@@ -@@ f@@ et@@ ched idea , but i really believe that it may be possible .
and then , my trans@@ l@@ ator left .
i noticed that at re@@ c@@ ess , she was the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team .
and i immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in at@@ lan@@ ta , ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a , who had an 1@@ 1@@ -year-old son .
and i said to the trans@@ l@@ ator , &quot; what did he say ? &quot;
so , these two came to lunch , and we got thrown out of the restaurant .
he had kids from all over korea living there , and he would find families for these kids .
and they spent a lot of time hu@@ d@@ d@@ led over a di@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ary .
so , i open the window , and i look out , and there &apos;s fl@@ am@@ es coming up the side of our hotel , and the hotel &apos;s on fire .
so , we ran to the ba@@ th@@ room , and got to@@ w@@ el@@ s , and put them over our faces , and the kids faces .
like , what could you do for a year ?
this is her cooking teacher .
this is sy@@ d@@ ne@@ y , who &apos;s going to be three years old in a couple of days .
but there was no evidence .
there are small planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
there is a lot more work we need to do with this .
so the question is : is that chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something which depends on the planet ?
and that deeper , under@@ lying point is that science is in the process of re@@ de@@ fin@@ ing life as we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the ob@@ ser@@ vable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here to here .
thank you very much .
see , uganda coming down , z@@ im@@ b@@ ab@@ we coming down , russia went to one percent .
you &apos;ll find the highest hiv rate in the world in african countries , and yet you &apos;ll find sen@@ e@@ g@@ al , down here -- the same rate as united states .
look here at kenya .
it could be that there is other things which makes trans@@ mission occur in a higher frequency .
we know that about 10@@ 6 billion people have ever lived .
this wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
and the result is an even bigger di@@ ver@@ gen@@ ce in a very short space of time than happened in germany .
it &apos;s the same with institutions .
you just have to feed me . &quot;
he was wrong .
so i want to end with three questions for the future billions , just ahead of 20@@ 16 , when the united states will lose its place as number one economy to china .
no , we may hang on , despite the huge bur@@ den@@ s of de@@ b@@ t that we &apos;ve ac@@ c@@ um@@ ul@@ ated , despite the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work e@@ th@@ ic and other parts of our historical mo@@ j@@ o .
ni@@ all , thank you .
there are many kinds of spider silk .
spider silk is almost entirely protein .
there &apos;s quite a bit of variation within the fi@@ ber@@ s that an individual spider can make .
spider sil@@ ks also have a lot of potential for their anti-@@ bal@@ li@@ stic cap@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties .
and what i want to call your attention to is not the mer@@ ma@@ id par@@ a@@ de itself , char@@ m@@ ing though it is , but rather to these photos .
you have to have physical structure .
there are more pictures . there are more ph@@ ot@@ o@@ gra@@ p@@ her@@ s .
and that sounds strange to our ears , but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the con@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ ors have con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ted a bel@@ o@@ w@@ -@@ average amount .
one of the first things that happens when you in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ alize a problem is that the first goal of the institution immediately shi@@ f@@ ts from whatever the n@@ om@@ in@@ al goal was to self-@@ pres@@ er@@ v@@ ation .
the inv@@ ent@@ ors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states right now t@@ ying themselves into k@@ n@@ ots , trying to figure out whether or not b@@ lo@@ g@@ gers are j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ alists .
it was produced by an@@ al@@ y@@ zing their com@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ ations patterns using a lot of these tools . and d@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ less the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week .
you &apos;ve got br@@ an , which is probably the he@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ est part of the bread for us , or the fiber for us because it is just lo@@ ad@@ ed with fiber , for the br@@ an is fiber .
everything in its place . first stage .
we call it &quot; pro@@ o@@ f@@ ing . &quot;
but let &apos;s kind of look at these stages again from the st@@ and@@ point of connections to possibly a deeper level -- all in my quest for an@@ s@@ w@@ er@@ ing the question , &quot; what is it about bread that &apos;s so special ? &quot;
that &apos;s a transformation , two different things .
and as they &apos;re shaped , they &apos;re raised again , all along pro@@ ving that they &apos;re alive , and developing character .
and if you make this bread , you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer .
it &apos;s going to be a kind of a re@@ fra@@ in as we go through the presentation .
it takes a long , long time to make these sc@@ or@@ es , and right now i &apos;m working on a piece that &apos;s 1@@ 80 pages in length , and it &apos;s just a big ch@@ un@@ k of my life , and i &apos;m just pulling out hair .
this is actually being per@@ formed by brian mc@@ wh@@ or@@ ter , who is an extraordinary per@@ for@@ m@@ er .
so that gives you a little taste of that piece .
what we did -- be@@ tt@@ y ra@@ pa@@ ch@@ ol@@ i , who was one of my students , and i -- was actually to give the babies two bo@@ w@@ ls of food : one bo@@ w@@ l of raw bro@@ c@@ col@@ i and one bo@@ w@@ l of de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous g@@ ol@@ d@@ fish cra@@ ck@@ ers .
i mean , after all , if you look at babies super@@ fi@@ ci@@ ally , they seem pretty us@@ eless .
and our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
the evidence makes them change that hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re atten@@ ding to becomes extremely bright and vi@@ vi@@ d , and everything else sort of goes dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the r &amp; amp ; d di@@ vision of the human species , &quot; says p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ist al@@ is@@ on g@@ op@@ ni@@ k . her research ex@@ pl@@ or@@ es the sophisticated in@@ t@@ el@@ li@@ gen@@ ce@@ -@@ gathering and de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on-@@ making that babies are really doing when they play .
and maybe , if i could have you for a quick de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion to show what the difference is -- because , i mean , it &apos;s very , very tri@@ vi@@ al .
and you re@@ pe@@ at that process over and over again , until you have something that walks -- in this case , in a straight line , like this .
what we really wanted was a full human body .
that &apos;s something that you cannot do right now .
so , here are just a few very simple sc@@ en@@ es of the guy just being ki@@ cked .
i &apos;m not quite sure why , but we &apos;ve done it anyway .
several stu@@ di@@ os are using this software now to produce virtual st@@ un@@ t@@ men , and they &apos;re going to hit the screen quite soon , actually , for some major pro@@ du@@ ctions .
that &apos;s what we thought was going to come out of this .
so this is about po@@ tt@@ y training -- as most of you , i hope , know .
but i must say , i &apos;ll never forget , when i was 13 years old , this happened .
i &apos;m making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy .
if you ever are feeling lon@@ ely , get a new york times col@@ um@@ n , because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of e@@ ma@@ ils . and the email i &apos;m getting a lot today is about f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion .
some of the stories are just so classic , and yet so under@@ st@@ and@@ able .
it tan@@ ked . no one ever bought it .
so there is a li@@ mit that we don &apos;t want to cross . so what is the answer ?
this is microsoft word . when you want to create a new b@@ lan@@ k document in word -- it could happen !
but actually , i believe there are really two micro@@ so@@ f@@ ts .
the other products were bac@@ ked by microsoft with an open standard , not apple &apos;s pro@@ pri@@ et@@ y standard .
and conver@@ sely , if somebody sen@@ ds me hate ma@@ il -- which happens daily -- i say , &quot; p@@ is@@ s off . &quot;
but i also , in looking at more powerful technologies and n@@ an@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ gy and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies , became very concerned about the potential for ab@@ use .
and so to li@@ mit the danger of these new things , we have to li@@ mit , ultimately , the ability of individuals to have access , essentially , to pan@@ de@@ mic power .
i think the challenge for us is -- i &apos;m very certain that that will happen , the challenge is , will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device ?
and if you make a three-dimensional structure , like a bu@@ ck@@ y@@ ball , they have all sorts of incredible properties .
and to give you an idea of the last fund that k@@ l@@ e@@ in@@ er raised was a $ 400 million fund , so this for us is a very sub@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ al fund .
and if you apply the notion of insurance more bro@@ ad@@ ly , you can use a more powerful force , a market force , to provide feedback .
until about a dozen years ago , when i was really cap@@ tu@@ red by ca@@ ves , and i really re-@@ focused most of my research in that direction .
so , wonderful things and gri@@ m things .
there is sub-@@ surface ice on that planet .
so they are , in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ cally , a s@@ lo@@ w@@ er li@@ fe@@ -@@ form .
in fact , there &apos;s so much energy available for biology in this cave , that there &apos;s actually a huge number of ca@@ v@@ e@@ f@@ ish .
we can see them .
it occurred to us a number of years ago that ca@@ ves have many properties that people have used and other organisms have used as habitat in the past .
any time you have a goal , there are some steps that need to be done , some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it .
and so it is with ar@@ ch@@ i@@ me@@ des , the great gre@@ e@@ k ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ ci@@ an .
for@@ ger@@ ies were pa@@ in@@ ted over it , and it su@@ ff@@ ered very b@@ ad@@ ly from m@@ old .
and so before we could start i@@ ma@@ ging ar@@ ch@@ i@@ me@@ des , we had to take this book apart .
and that &apos;s what it looks like .
but as the el@@ e@@ c@@ tr@@ ons go round at the speed of light , they shed x@@ -@@ ra@@ ys .
this was a bad idea , because p@@ hi@@ li@@ p of ma@@ ce@@ don had a son called al@@ ex@@ an@@ der the great , and they lost the battle of ch@@ a@@ er@@ on@@ e@@ a .
because institutions at the moment con@@ fine their data with copyright re@@ stri@@ ctions and that sort of thing .
the original o@@ w@@ ner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ a@@ stic wine bu@@ ff@@ s of the 18@@ th century .
it was like , 1@@ 60 dollars for this ?
it has four bal@@ con@@ ies .
a re@@ cur@@ r@@ ing theme is that a lot of these things are from japan -- you &apos;ll start to notice .
i mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet .
there was one object that i could not get my hands on , and that was the 19@@ 4@@ 7 ch@@ e@@ v@@ al b@@ lan@@ c .
and i don &apos;t -- call my pal@@ ate a p@@ hi@@ li@@ st@@ ine pal@@ ate -- so it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean something that i wasn &apos;t im@@ pres@@ sed , but i was not the only one there who had that reaction .
earlier this year , a virtual asteroid in it sold for 3@@ 3@@ 0,000 real dollars .
the really interesting stuff about vi@@ r@@ tu@@ ality is what you can measure with it .
now , i could make a game called p@@ i@@ e@@ cra@@ ft , where all you had to do was get a million pi@@ es or a thousand pi@@ es .
if they &apos;re real boxes , there &apos;s not much we can do , but in a game we can just say , &quot; right , well .
this is absolutely cru@@ ci@@ al , and vi@@ r@@ tu@@ ality is da@@ zz@@ ling at de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing this .
and i want to tell you a quick story about 19@@ 9@@ 9 -- a video game called e@@ ver@@ quest .
it &apos;s about how individual en@@ ga@@ ge@@ ment can be transformed by the psychological and the neuro@@ lo@@ gi@@ cal lessons we can learn from watching people that are playing games .
it &apos;s a type of fo@@ s@@ si@@ li@@ zed d@@ ent@@ al pla@@ que that is called o@@ ff@@ i@@ ci@@ ally d@@ ent@@ al cal@@ cul@@ us .
i &apos;m ell@@ en , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
there &apos;s definitely hunger in america : 4@@ 9 million people and almost 16@@ .@@ 7 million children .
and their far@@ ms are also large .
it &apos;s the th@@ ir@@ ti@@ e@@ th an@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ary of g@@ m@@ o crops and the big g@@ ul@@ p , chicken mc@@ nu@@ g@@ gets , high f@@ ru@@ c@@ to@@ se corn sy@@ ru@@ p , the farm crisis in america and the change in how we &apos;ve ad@@ d@@ res@@ sed agriculture inter@@ na@@ ti@@ on@@ ally .
this is a construction h@@ el@@ met that i received two years ago at the gro@@ und@@ breaking of the largest project i , and my fi@@ r@@ m , have ever been involved in .
but i &apos;m going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very pe@@ dan@@ tic stat@@ em@@ ents .
if we are so good at our cra@@ ft shouldn &apos;t we be able to con@@ c@@ ei@@ ve of an architectural man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation that slides se@@ am@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ly through the project &apos;s and the cli@@ ent &apos;s con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts ?
the architectural man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation was frankly just du@@ m@@ b .
and here is the f@@ ru@@ i@@ tion of that in ac@@ tu@@ ality .
the second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an op@@ er@@ a house .
here it is in a flat floor con@@ fi@@ gu@@ ration .
so i &apos;m going to talk today about collecting stories in some un@@ conventional ways .
one such project is about a year and a half old .
these are the images that are automatically constructed .
when i was a@@ wake , with the camera around my ne@@ ck .
you can see a ti@@ m@@ el@@ ine , showing you the exciting moments throughout the story .
it &apos;s bal@@ e@@ en . moving on .
a 2@@ 8@@ -year-old cell phone shop o@@ w@@ ner .
an 8@@ 1@@ -year-old it@@ in@@ er@@ ant farmer .
what if she saw the truth after just one year , what would she do for the next 35 years in her life ?
&quot; to make some money and to open a store &quot; was the indian road worker .
out of an@@ es@@ the@@ tic , he had let them know that he wanted to be there , and he had given me about a two percent chance of living .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , writing has certain ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ges .
it &apos;s almost impossible to do that with your hand except in sh@@ or@@ th@@ and , and then communication is limited .
very funny people , if that &apos;s what lo@@ l means .
you don &apos;t just z@@ i@@ p right into it .
if somebody from 19@@ 7@@ 3 looked at what was on a dor@@ mit@@ ory message board in 19@@ 9@@ 3 , the s@@ lan@@ g would have changed a little bit since the era of &quot; love story , &quot; but they would understand what was on that message board .
i &apos;m over@@ time , so i just wanted to say you can , if you &apos;re in new york , you can check out my work at the wh@@ it@@ ne@@ y bi@@ en@@ ni@@ al next week , and also at b@@ it@@ forms g@@ al@@ l@@ er@@ y in ch@@ el@@ sea .
afghanistan does not pos@@ e an ex@@ i@@ st@@ en@@ ti@@ al threat to global security .
and the same is true for the tro@@ op@@ s .
instead , there was a li@@ t@@ any of astonishing optimism .
di@@ p@@ lo@@ ma@@ ts are locked in em@@ bas@@ sy com@@ pounds .
and finally , we need to understand that in bo@@ s@@ ni@@ a and ko@@ so@@ v@@ o , a lot of the secret of what we did , a lot of the secret of our success , was our hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ty -- was the t@@ ent@@ ative nature of our en@@ ga@@ ge@@ ment .
r@@ ory , you mentioned li@@ b@@ ya at the end .
so , you see two examples here .
there &apos;s an example of the same thing on a finger , showing you basically what it looks like .
there are also di@@ p@@ sticks , but if you look at the di@@ p@@ sticks , they &apos;re for another kind of ur@@ ine analysis .
the tri@@ age problem . that &apos;s a hard problem for reasons that i won &apos;t go through .
there &apos;s another very interesting connection here , and that is that what one wants to do is to pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system .
so , i think it &apos;s as low-@@ cost as we &apos;re likely to be able to come up and make things .
and we &apos;ve decided that we should think about this not so much in terms of cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there is a book written called , &quot; what &apos;s the matter with k@@ an@@ s@@ as ? &quot;
so we have to ask why .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , you &apos;re not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you .
so we can think more about things like street gri@@ ds .
i joke , but i only half joke , that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb , no one will believe you till they get a cat scan , m@@ r@@ i or or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c con@@ su@@ lt .
and bell then goes on to explain to the students .
so within a few years , in the late 18@@ 0@@ 0@@ s , early 19@@ 0@@ 0@@ s , all of a sudden , the bar@@ ber surgeon had given way to the ph@@ y@@ si@@ ci@@ an who was trying to make a di@@ ag@@ no@@ sis .
there &apos;s a real dis@@ j@@ un@@ ction between the patient &apos;s perception and our own per@@ ce@@ p@@ tions as ph@@ y@@ si@@ ci@@ ans of the best medical care .
i was also in@@ flu@@ en@@ ced by another experience that i had , again , when i was in texas , before i moved to stanford .
the bad news is we don &apos;t know exactly what &apos;s causing this , but here &apos;s what you should do , here &apos;s what we should do . &quot;
i remember so many huge , h@@ ol@@ lo@@ wed out , ha@@ un@@ ted eyes star@@ ing up at me as i per@@ formed this ri@@ tu@@ al .
some people call us de@@ b@@ un@@ kers , which is kind of a negative term .
in this case , we tested it .
for those of you in the back , it says here : &quot; then a mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le oc@@ cur@@ s .
and it wasn &apos;t solved until 16@@ 5@@ 5 .
religious i@@ con@@ o@@ graphy .
it &apos;s getting the dead to talk back that &apos;s the really hard part .
but my friend , si@@ m@@ on s@@ ing@@ h , the particle physicist now turned science e@@ du@@ cat@@ or , and he wrote the book &quot; the big bang , &quot; and so on .
now open your eyes .
you can open it up completely . it &apos;s water@@ proof .
but it got me thinking about the fact that these guys , at least most of them , know what it is that they do for a living .
and everyone said it was impossible .
you can make a lot of change . you can get roads built .
and it &apos;s something that people have wanted forever .
you don &apos;t need everyone .
hu@@ go ch@@ a@@ ve@@ z did not invent the dis@@ affected middle and lower class of ven@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ a . he mer@@ ely led them .
and around and around and around it goes .
they connect people to one another .
the reason ? today &apos;s current modern medicine is a 6@@ 0@@ -@@ year-old technique .
however , there &apos;s a catch .
this makes it 16@@ 8 times faster , over 2@@ 6@@ ,000 times less expensive , and over 400 times more sensitive than our current standard for pan@@ cre@@ a@@ tic cancer detection .
my experience , however , in the islamic world is very different .
so , for example , there is the character of no@@ or@@ a .
and why does sex make babies , and babies sp@@ el@@ l er@@ o@@ tic disaster in c@@ ou@@ pl@@ es ?
because ther@@ ei@@ n lies the mystery of er@@ o@@ tic@@ ism .
and then , more importantly , in this des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion about the other or myself -- it &apos;s the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no ne@@ e@@ din@@ ess in desire .
it &apos;s the pi@@ vo@@ t , it &apos;s biology , it &apos;s the natural in@@ st@@ in@@ ct .
that &apos;s the beginning of desire , that ex@@ pl@@ or@@ atory needs curiosity , discovery .
they understand that there is an er@@ o@@ tic space that bel@@ on@@ gs to each of them .
other places around the country had similar rooms .
in a go@@ th@@ ic ca@@ the@@ d@@ ra@@ l , this kind of music is perfect .
okay .
these are played mainly in small rooms .
so the early hi@@ p@@ -@@ ho@@ p guys would loop certain se@@ ctions .
so i asked myself : okay , is this a model for creation , this a@@ da@@ p@@ tation that we do ?
thank you very much .
and he turned to me , and he said , &quot; put her there ! &quot;
how do we solve these three problems that i &apos;d like to mention ?
al@@ b@@ er@@ t einstein -- i was just talking to someone , when i was speaking at pr@@ in@@ c@@ et@@ on , and i met mr. einstein .
what &apos;s life all about ? why am i here ?
i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture .
about 300 of them were there .
he put it on a personal basis .
a french hi@@ st@@ or@@ ian said , two centuries later , &quot; s@@ el@@ do@@ m has so mi@@ gh@@ ty an in@@ t@@ el@@ le@@ ct sub@@ mit@@ ted with such hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ty to the authority of j@@ es@@ us ch@@ r@@ ist . &quot;
or he was what he c@@ la@@ im@@ ed to be .
i will not m@@ ou@@ r@@ n the dead with mur@@ der nor suicide .
but i &apos;m going to need you to just sit for like 10 minutes and hold a woman who is not here .
i never was pure .
harvest baby teeth .
with te@@ ars in my eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
2010 : a young woman stands before president si@@ r@@ le@@ a@@ f and gives her te@@ st@@ im@@ on@@ y of how she and her si@@ bl@@ ings live together , their father and mother died during the war .
we go into rural communities and all we do , like has been done in this room , is create the space .
i failed to do this .
i want to look back 20 years from now and see that there &apos;s another li@@ ber@@ i@@ an girl , gh@@ an@@ a@@ i@@ an girl , ni@@ ger@@ i@@ an girl , e@@ th@@ i@@ op@@ ian girl standing on this ted stage .
l@@ g : you &apos;re welcome .
li@@ ck@@ li@@ der for@@ es@@ a@@ w computers doing all the r@@ ou@@ tin@@ i@@ z@@ able work that was required to pre@@ p@@ are the way for in@@ si@@ gh@@ ts and decision making .
every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing ar@@ ray of sen@@ s@@ ors : your phone , your credit card , your computer . the result is big data , and it actually pres@@ ents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition .
these records were human resource forms .
by im@@ ple@@ m@@ ent@@ ing a super@@ i@@ or process , what was otherwise a task for 40 people over three months became a simple job for three people in 40 hours , all vi@@ ct@@ or@@ ies for hu@@ man@@ -@@ computer sy@@ m@@ bio@@ sis .
we should stop looking outside .
drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
because people say , &quot; b@@ lo@@ o@@ dy hell mate , i haven &apos;t got time to get fit .
she turned out to be a much bigger dog than i &apos;d anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated .
these im@@ p@@ ac@@ ts are coming everyone &apos;s way .
a national highway construction bo@@ om was added to our problems .
think bike sh@@ op@@ s , ju@@ ice stands .
in the post-@@ k@@ at@@ r@@ in@@ a era , we have still more in common .
you probably all have it , and if you haven &apos;t , you need to .
help me make green the new black . help me make sustainability se@@ x@@ y .
so i thought , this would be an opportunity to use scratch to make an interactive card for my mom .
but actually i &apos;m sort of s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ al about this term .
in this case , you take a move block , s@@ na@@ p it into a st@@ ac@@ k , and the st@@ ac@@ ks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story , in this case controlling the big fish .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
so as kids like vi@@ ctor are creating projects like this , they &apos;re learning important concepts like v@@ ari@@ ab@@ les , but that &apos;s just the start .
what i want to talk about is , as background , is the idea that cars are art .
i want to talk about this .
and i think this idea of soul , as being at the heart of great cars , is very app@@ li@@ c@@ able . you all know it . you know a car when you &apos;ve seen it , with soul . you know how strong this is .
this is one of my favorite paintings , it really des@@ cri@@ b@@ es our relationship with cars .
right ? and they decided that instead of , like , having a studio , and six or seven a@@ par@@ t@@ ments , it was cheaper to r@@ ent e@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ e@@ th ta@@ y@@ l@@ or &apos;s ex@@ -@@ house in m@@ ali@@ b@@ u .
there was a whole lot of di@@ al@@ o@@ g .
and i think we felt much closer that day , we cut a lot of st@@ r@@ ings that didn &apos;t need to be there , and we for@@ ged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about .
we didn &apos;t fly him to boston .
i have a small lab .
we &apos;ve comp@@ le@@ ted now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of sal@@ es@@ people and mar@@ ke@@ te@@ ers that can tell us how to position this drug against the other .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each .
what he didn &apos;t explain was why the ent@@ ro@@ p@@ y was ever low in the first place .
unlike the low ent@@ ro@@ p@@ y of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at least have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy .
and so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will di@@ l@@ ute away , there will always be some radiation , some ther@@ ma@@ l flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ations , even in empty space .
but there will also be large flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ations .
it &apos;s co@@ ol@@ ing off .
this is a br@@ ute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions .
i had never used a computer .
it was the future i couldn &apos;t accept .
so i would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the africans , and the poor who are struggling with your dreams .
so , here , whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually re@@ p@@ li@@ cated inside the digital world just using this small device that i made , around eight years back , in 2000 .
i took it very literally , and took my bike h@@ el@@ met , put a little cut over there so that the pro@@ je@@ ctor actually f@@ its ni@@ c@@ ely .
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements , but , interestingly , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand .
and why only computers ? we can just play with papers .
all of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in india .
this is ju@@ an car@@ los , king of sp@@ a@@ in .
this is going to be the third largest park in rio by june this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep down underground to make a station like that .
i &apos;m going to give a fast example here .
almost every year we have these land@@ slides , which are terrible .
we are below average in terms of traffic in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents in the city .
a city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party , which are cities .
the best answer lies in trying to re@@ con@@ st@@ ru@@ ct a dar@@ win@@ ian evolutionary history of our artistic and a@@ es@@ the@@ tic ta@@ st@@ es .
so evolution &apos;s trick is to make them beautiful , to have them ex@@ er@@ t a kind of ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them .
and some , in any event , are too big to use for bu@@ t@@ cher@@ y .
our powerful reaction to images , to the expression of emotion in art , to the beauty of music , to the night sky , will be with us and our des@@ c@@ en@@ dan@@ ts for as long as the human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a rather complex system , but let me try to explain it , maybe si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fy it .
so over here , you can see how the computer under@@ stands the environment , and because you cannot see the vi@@ bra@@ tion , we actually put red led &apos;s on the driver so that you can see what &apos;s happening .
now let &apos;s see if mark a@@ vo@@ i@@ ds it .
or for the blind , everyday home app@@ li@@ ances -- in the educational setting , in the office setting .
a sub@@ t@@ le con@@ di@@ ti@@ on@@ ing process had be@@ gun , the im@@ p@@ li@@ cation that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the fact that i did meant that something was very seriously wrong .
my mental health status had been a cat@@ al@@ y@@ st for dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation , ver@@ b@@ al ab@@ use , and physical and sexual as@@ s@@ au@@ lt , and i &apos;d been told by my p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ r@@ ist , &quot; el@@ e@@ an@@ or , you &apos;d be better off with cancer , because cancer is easier to cure than s@@ ch@@ i@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ ia . &quot;
to par@@ ap@@ h@@ r@@ ase ch@@ a@@ ve@@ z , once social change begins , it cannot be rever@@ sed .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going through at this time .
so , what i &apos;m pro@@ posing is that there is where we should be looking for life , rather than on mars , although mars is , of course , also a very pro@@ mis@@ ing and interesting place .
and the regular a@@ st@@ r@@ on@@ om@@ ers were sc@@ or@@ n@@ ful about this .
because it means that -- the way life can live out there , it has enormous ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ges as compared with living on a planet .
there was another object , this sort of to@@ w@@ er@@ ing piece of furniture with creatures and gar@@ go@@ y@@ les and nu@@ di@@ ty -- pretty scary stuff , when you &apos;re a little kid .
and so the first projects were sort of hum@@ ble , but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way , and maybe finding some new f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ality .
but the other thing that is hu@@ man@@ i@@ stic about ja@@ w@@ bone is that we really decided to take out all the te@@ ch@@ ie stuff , and all the n@@ er@@ dy stuff out of it , and try to make it as beautiful as we can .
so we called it y water . and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the br@@ and@@ ing , it all becomes deeply connected .
but this is my ne@@ p@@ he@@ w , an@@ th@@ on@@ y , in s@@ wi@@ t@@ z@@ er@@ land , and he had the laptop for an afternoon , and i had to take it back . it was hard .
y@@ ves be@@ ha@@ r : designing objects that tell stories
thank you .
my a@@ un@@ t , an incredibly ar@@ tic@@ u@@ late and brilliant woman , was wi@@ do@@ wed early .
she was the most determined ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate for women &apos;s rights i had ever heard .
look at those young girls who go back to school when ac@@ id is thrown in their face . &quot;
the world la@@ y@@ ma bo@@ w@@ ie was given was a world at war .
then things get ten@@ se .
they have to ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ate .
they &apos;re the ones from my generation , the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is pa@@ per@@ less , and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen .
well , ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
and if you wonder why this is interesting at all , you have to see the rest of s@@ au@@ d@@ i ar@@ ab@@ ia because it &apos;s a country which is stri@@ ct@@ ly divided between the se@@ x@@ es .
maybe some things are bad tra@@ di@@ tions and they need to be changed .
let me give you an example : in tur@@ key where i come from , which is a very hy@@ per@@ -@@ se@@ cul@@ ar re@@ public , until very recently we used to have what i call se@@ cul@@ ar@@ ism police , which would gu@@ ard the uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties against v@@ ei@@ led students .
now if i were the only person thinking that way , we would be in trouble .
in the 19th century , when muslims were looking at europe as an example , they were independent ; they were more self-@@ con@@ fi@@ dent .
that &apos;s why the e@@ .@@ u@@ . process , tur@@ key &apos;s effort to join the e@@ .@@ u@@ . , has been su@@ p@@ por@@ ted inside tur@@ key by the is@@ lam@@ ic@@ -@@ pi@@ ous , while some se@@ cul@@ ar nations were against that .
there &apos;s a very large nose that doesn &apos;t seem to be connected to anything in particular .
today , a century later , when researchers want to vis@@ u@@ alize neurons , they light them up from the inside rather than dar@@ k@@ en@@ ing them .
car@@ l s@@ ch@@ o@@ on@@ over : how to look inside the brain
but this trend is less un@@ am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ous .
but for many parts of africa , a col@@ le@@ a@@ gue of mine once put it this way , &quot; the ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fire on tu@@ es@@ day night was reached just in time for the gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de to start on we@@ d@@ n@@ es@@ day morning . &quot;
yet instead of gr@@ as@@ ping this opportunity , local and international leaders soon dis@@ engaged and became di@@ stra@@ cted by the second in@@ ti@@ fa@@ da , the events of 9 / 11 and the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional design requires a ke@@ en focus on issues , innovative thinking and fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble and well-@@ funded im@@ ple@@ m@@ ent@@ ation .
st@@ ro@@ ma@@ to@@ li@@ tes are the heroes in my story .
s@@ hal@@ low se@@ as n@@ ur@@ tu@@ red life early on , and that &apos;s where it mor@@ ph@@ ed into more complex forms .
fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s covered con@@ tin@@ ents . mi@@ gra@@ tions got under@@ way .
some mammals turned back to water .
every man des@@ er@@ ves the opportunity to grow a little bit of lu@@ x@@ ur@@ y .
but there was nothing for this cause , so we married growing a mu@@ sta@@ ch@@ e with pro@@ state cancer , and then we created our ta@@ gl@@ ine , which is , &quot; changing the face of men &apos;s health . &quot;
we had m@@ o bro@@ s from canada , from the u.s. , and from the u.k. e@@ ma@@ il@@ ing us and calling us and saying , hey , there &apos;s nothing for pro@@ state cancer .
and i say to them , &quot; last year we were fortunate enough to have 4@@ 50,000 c@@ el@@ e@@ bri@@ ty am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors . &quot;
so those conversations , getting men engaged in this , at whatever age , is so cri@@ tically important , and in my view so much more important than the f@@ un@@ ds we raise .
he could see what was happening to his forest , to his environment , because he was taken under his grandfather &apos;s wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people .
so when i think of that , i wonder what our grand@@ children and our gre@@ at@@ -@@ grand@@ children , when they ask themselves that question , i wonder how they will answer .
we need new models of being a leader and a human in the world .
she works with people like mur@@ al@@ i k@@ r@@ is@@ h@@ n@@ a .
over a lifetime , through everything , through the cultural revolution and everything af@@ ter@@ ward , he &apos;s kept collecting , so that he now has over eight million pieces in his mu@@ se@@ um@@ s do@@ c@@ um@@ ent@@ ing con@@ te@@ m@@ por@@ ary chinese history .
it just happens .
&apos;@@ my world &apos; is sub@@ je@@ ctive .
or perhaps he was just a yo@@ g@@ i who was sitting on a rock , star@@ ing at the sky and the sun and the moon .
and if you have lived an extraordinary life , you will be w@@ el@@ com@@ ed to el@@ y@@ si@@ um , or what the french call &quot; ch@@ am@@ p@@ s-@@ é@@ l@@ y@@ s@@ é@@ es &quot; -- -- the heaven of the heroes .
and so , you have these grand ri@@ tu@@ als where great images of mother go@@ d@@ des@@ ses are built and wor@@ shi@@ ped for 10 days ...
you see , what is business but the result of how the market be@@ ha@@ ves and how the organization be@@ ha@@ ves ?
you see , this is what india is today . the ground reality is based on a cy@@ cli@@ cal world view .
you see , he has e@@ st@@ ab@@ li@@ shed the largest re@@ tail chain , called big ba@@ z@@ a@@ ar .
&quot; why did i do the setting , why i don &apos;t care for the processes . just understand me , please . &quot;
de@@ v@@ du@@ t@@ t pat@@ tan@@ a@@ i@@ k takes an e@@ ye@@ -@@ opening look at the my@@ ths of india and of the west -- and shows how these two fundamentally different sets of be@@ li@@ e@@ f@@ s about god , death and heaven help us con@@ si@@ st@@ ently mis@@ understand one another .
but guess what ? this is almost 20@@ 12 , and saying to the world , &quot; i am totally , completely comp@@ et@@ ent , &quot; is d@@ am@@ ning yourself with the fa@@ in@@ test of pra@@ ise .
your interest is compared to what ?
your friends and family will be ga@@ ther@@ ed in the ce@@ me@@ ter@@ y , and there , b@@ es@@ i@@ de your gra@@ v@@ es@@ i@@ te will be a t@@ om@@ b@@ stone , and in@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed on that t@@ om@@ b@@ stone , it will say , &quot; here lies a di@@ st@@ ing@@ u@@ ished engineer who invented v@@ el@@ cr@@ o . &quot;
you are so happy . it &apos;s the conversation a parent wants to hear , because your kid &apos;s good in math , and you know you &apos;re going to like what comes next .
it is because you are — you know what you are .
i don &apos;t have any pat@@ ents , and i &apos;ve never received any money from a medical i@@ ma@@ ging company , and i am not se@@ e@@ king your vote .
so how do you know if your bre@@ a@@ sts are dense ?
ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ un@@ d gener@@ ates more bi@@ op@@ si@@ es that are un@@ necessary relative to other technologies , so it &apos;s not wi@@ d@@ ely used .
if you can find a tumor when it &apos;s less than a c@@ en@@ ti@@ meter , survival ex@@ ce@@ e@@ ds 90 percent , but dro@@ ps off rapidly as tumor size increases .
but the m@@ b@@ i image shows that tumor much more clearly , as well as a second tumor , which pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly influence that patient &apos;s sur@@ gi@@ cal options .
it takes a radi@@ ologist years of speci@@ al@@ ty training to become expert in di@@ ff@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ ating the normal an@@ at@@ om@@ ic detail from the wor@@ ris@@ om@@ e finding .
some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later , and most women , th@@ an@@ k@@ fully , survive .
d@@ um da ta da d@@ um d@@ um da ta da d@@ um da ta da da that &apos;s a lot of power .
we ga@@ ther together these ph@@ y@@ si@@ ci@@ sts in los al@@ am@@ os to see what they &apos;ll build .
m@@ il@@ l .
you were sleeping during that class .
that &apos;s a st@@ un@@ ning vision .
it &apos;s just a matter of the consequences .
so let &apos;s cut to the ch@@ ase .
what did i do ? did i follow my gut ?
well that &apos;s interesting . that &apos;s a different way of thinking .
basically the hom@@ un@@ cul@@ us is the vis@@ u@@ alization of a human being where each part of the body is pro@@ por@@ tional to the surface it takes in the brain .
this is white noise .
and d@@ b will probably roll toward you .
i just do that to make money .
thank you .
and he told me , after a long silence , &quot; i wonder , ma@@ th@@ i@@ e@@ u , if people won &apos;t be more fascinated by your ben@@ ches than by my videos . &quot;
this is the reason why i created , with david ed@@ ward , a scientist of harvard university , an object able to ab@@ sor@@ b the toxic elements using those kind of plants .
no , not po@@ t@@ at@@ o@@ es , but to@@ ma@@ toes , ar@@ o@@ matic plants and so on .
it &apos;s a lot easier to be li@@ gh@@ the@@ ar@@ ted about other people &apos;s tragedy than your own , and i want to keep it in the spirit of the conference .
and in the words of mal@@ col@@ m g@@ la@@ d@@ well , cra@@ ck co@@ ca@@ ine was the ex@@ tra@@ -@@ ch@@ un@@ ky version of to@@ ma@@ to s@@ au@@ ce for the inner city .
he was really a curious sight to be seen .
went up to the floor , the second floor , and said : &quot; hey , guys .
ok , just like mc@@ don@@ al@@ d &apos;s .
so for com@@ par@@ is@@ on &apos;s pur@@ pos@@ es , let &apos;s think about some other walk of life where you may expect might be extremely ris@@ ky .
the other thing the gang was very , very good at was marketing and tri@@ ck@@ er@@ y .
so economists talk about game theory -- that every two-@@ person game has a n@@ as@@ h e@@ qu@@ i@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
sk@@ y@@ sur@@ f@@ ing is sk@@ y@@ di@@ ving with a board on the feet .
extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step , if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge .
u@@ e : no@@ pe . it &apos;s just smoke .
i have oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ al meetings with scientists .
so here i had the hope that by in@@ ser@@ ting some natural elements , if you want -- some fo@@ g -- i could make the space tan@@ gi@@ ble .
ne@@ go@@ ti@@ able meaning that it makes a difference whether you do something or not .
the big mountains far away , they move less .
how do we create an idea which is both t@@ ol@@ er@@ ant to indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality , and also to col@@ le@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty , without po@@ l@@ ari@@ zing the two into two different op@@ pos@@ ites ?
i spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean , one that fo@@ c@@ uses on at@@ tra@@ cting animals instead of sc@@ ar@@ ing them away .
but even more incredible was the fo@@ ot@@ age shot from the tri@@ ton sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble .
taking them off the dead , flat pages .
at the time , he was teaching c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ cs at tr@@ in@@ ity college in du@@ b@@ li@@ n .
n@@ at@@ al@@ ie mer@@ ch@@ ant : singing old po@@ em@@ s to life
and you can &apos;t get more alien than the dolphin .
so as an adult , when i started to read about the amazing bre@@ a@@ k@@ th@@ r@@ ou@@ gh@@ s with pen@@ ny pat@@ ter@@ son and ko@@ k@@ o , with su@@ e sa@@ va@@ ge@@ -@@ ru@@ m@@ b@@ au@@ g@@ h and k@@ an@@ z@@ i , pan@@ ban@@ is@@ h@@ a , ir@@ en@@ e pe@@ p@@ per@@ berg , al@@ e@@ x the par@@ ro@@ t , i got all excited .
v@@ in@@ t c@@ er@@ f : n@@ g : speaking as one .
now , here at the national a@@ qu@@ ari@@ um we are committed to ex@@ c@@ ell@@ ence in animal care , to research , and to conservation .
what we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together .
today . this is the first time you &apos;re talking about it .
this is an image of me and my daughter holding the is@@ ra@@ el@@ i fla@@ g .
because it &apos;s working , put me in a poster now .
and they just came , and it was so much , i remember one day , mi@@ ch@@ al , she was talking with the journalist , and she was asking him , &quot; who &apos;s g@@ on@@ na see the show ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;
this is not the is@@ ra@@ el@@ -@@ lo@@ v@@ es@@ -@@ iran . this is not my page .
and sometimes war is ine@@ vi@@ table , sometimes , but maybe &#91; with &#93; effort , we can avoid it .
and what we &apos;d like to say with &quot; yes is more &quot; is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural a@@ v@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de is almost always ne@@ ga@@ tively defined , as who or what we are against .
and we saw this guy , ha@@ i@@ ba@@ o .
gra@@ du@@ ally , you get this idea that sustainable life is less fun than normal life .
so if you come to the ex@@ p@@ o , go straight to the dan@@ ish pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on , get a dan@@ ish bike , and then continue on that to visit the other pa@@ vi@@ li@@ ons .
it was kind of interesting because in the morning , from 9 to 11 , they were dis@@ c@@ us@@ sing the ba@@ il@@ out p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge -- how many billions to invest in saving the dan@@ ish economy .
it &apos;s actually a st@@ and@@ -up product from s@@ wi@@ t@@ z@@ er@@ land , because in s@@ wi@@ t@@ z@@ er@@ land they have a natural need for di@@ ag@@ on@@ al el@@ e@@ v@@ ators .
we quite often make little movies .
what i &apos;d like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world .
but of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
so what i &apos;m pro@@ posing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of choices .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
the in@@ ci@@ den@@ ce of malaria is about a couple of &#91; million &#93; people get infected every year .
what this really does is that it makes us think about our pri@@ ori@@ ties .
it &apos;s a good film in the sense that i certainly want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect em@@ mer@@ i@@ ch to cast bra@@ d pit@@ t in his next movie di@@ g@@ ging lat@@ r@@ ines in tan@@ z@@ ani@@ a or something .
they had all the same material but they could go va@@ st@@ ly outside the sc@@ op@@ e of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts .
its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is un@@ mat@@ ched . &quot;
second , china has been able to me@@ an@@ ing@@ fully improve its income ine@@ quality without changing the political con@@ st@@ ru@@ ct .
freedom house finds that although 50 percent of the world &apos;s countries today are democratic , 70 percent of those countries are il@@ liberal in the sense that people don &apos;t have free speech or freedom of movement .
because ultimately , the question before us , and the question before seven billion people on the planet is , how can we create pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ity ?
the ser@@ if is not really in place .
we become what we really are interested in .
it just came out six months ago , and it &apos;s getting unbelievable tra@@ ction right now in germany .
we need to maintain an op@@ ti@@ m@@ um temperature for the growth .
i guess it also looks a little bit like human skin , which in@@ tri@@ gu@@ es me .
but i do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly pre@@ ci@@ ous natural resources .
chinese workers are not forced into f@@ ac@@ tor@@ ies because of our in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able desire for i@@ po@@ ds .
just because a person sp@@ ends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that , a piece of something .
m@@ in &apos;s sister turned to him and said , &quot; some people actually understand these things . you don &apos;t understand sh@@ it . &quot;
this is the co@@ a@@ ch pur@@ se that m@@ in gave me on the train home to visit her family .
the t@@ al@@ i@@ b@@ an now run their own schools .
if any child is found vi@@ ol@@ ating these rules , he is se@@ ver@@ ely re@@ pri@@ m@@ and@@ ed .
when i look at suicide b@@ om@@ ber@@ s younger than me , or my age , i get so inspired by their ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ c attacks .
and that will have to a@@ wait the ar@@ ri@@ val , back at en@@ c@@ el@@ a@@ du@@ s , of the sp@@ ac@@ e@@ cra@@ f@@ ts , hopefully some time in the near future , specifically e@@ qui@@ pped to address that particular question .
was the internet actually a place that you could visit ?
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started thinking about this , there was one cable down the western coast of africa , represented in this map by steve song as that thin black line .
and that doesn &apos;t seem right .
and that data , layer by layer , gets passed through the machine , starting at the base of the product and de@@ pos@@ it@@ ing material , layer upon layer , in@@ f@@ using the new layer of materials to the old layer in an ad@@ di@@ tive process .
it &apos;s created de@@ pos@@ it@@ ing layers of about four mi@@ cr@@ ons .
there &apos;s a lower chance of re@@ je@@ ction .
you can just make it physically on the spot .
here &apos;s the product being built .
without a doubt in my mind , i believe that this technology is going to cause a manufacturing revolution and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it .
he worried that if he called her by that name , especially out@@ do@@ ors , outside in public , he might be seen as end@@ or@@ sing bin la@@ den &apos;s idea of j@@ i@@ had .
they use his r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ic .
the good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be .
but many of these other factors that were in play are now even stronger than before . half the work is already done .
i was with my friend s@@ us@@ an m@@ ei@@ s@@ el@@ as , the photographer , in the ma@@ th@@ are valley sl@@ um@@ s .
and she said , &quot; you know , the poverty wasn &apos;t so bad . it was the hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation and the em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ s@@ ment of it all . &quot;
you think i will miss the violence or the drugs ? the lack of pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y ?
the first was , instead of the months flying by , for@@ gotten , the time was much more me@@ mor@@ able .
but they &apos;re less likely to stick .
and my first year at cal@@ tech , i continued the business .
some people even say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life .
solar cells collect light for four and a half hours though .
but they &apos;re also very high pressure , so they &apos;re dangerous .
that &apos;s a heat engine .
it &apos;s just a small cy@@ lin@@ der down here which holds the gener@@ ator inside and all the lin@@ ka@@ ge and it &apos;s the hot cap -- the hot cy@@ lin@@ der on the top -- this part gets hot , this part is cool , and electricity comes out .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it will cool itself .
this is the map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a bi@@ r@@ th@@ right to just use that up as fast as we are , i think .
we blow it up and look at the pieces .
it &apos;s a flying laboratory that we took to make me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ ments in the region of this molecule .
but i kept writing bad poetry , and he didn &apos;t blow up the math building , but he went to cu@@ b@@ a .
so , good things come out of , you know , in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sion -- -- which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
i work for the new y@@ or@@ ker , and i do co@@ vers , and 9 / 11 happened and it was , you know , a complete and u@@ t@@ ter end of the world as we knew it .
and then , &quot; be ob@@ sc@@ ure clearly ! be wild of t@@ on@@ gue in a way we can understand . &quot;
&quot; and decided his top people had to be ex@@ tin@@ c@@ ti@@ fied . &quot;
this man is angry because somebody th@@ re@@ w oni@@ ons all over the sta@@ ir@@ case , and basically -- you know , i guess oni@@ ons are a theme here .
and she d@@ ated george ger@@ sh@@ win , so , you know , get out .
t@@ d : from the time i was very young , on@@ ward , i was given a lot of different res@@ po@@ n@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ties , and it always seemed to me , when i was young , that everything was laid out before me .
that &apos;s wonderful , but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside .
t@@ d : la@@ k@@ sh@@ m@@ i has worked incredibly hard , even in in@@ vi@@ ting me , let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen , and i was somewhat resi@@ st@@ ant at times , and i was also very nervous throughout this week .
so in these two examples , we had basically machines that learned how to walk in si@@ mu@@ lation , and also machines that learned how to walk in reality .
when i say &quot; we , &quot; i &apos;m at the council on foreign rel@@ a@@ tions .
but nobody be@@ li@@ e@@ ves it will actually be particularly effective if we have a real out@@ break .
most of the spending in the bush ad@@ min@@ i@@ stra@@ tion has actually been more related to the an@@ th@@ ra@@ x results and bio@@ -@@ terrorism threat .
we know the virus will mu@@ ta@@ te . it will be a different virus .
but actually in scientific community there is great debate about what percentage of flu trans@@ mission between people is from s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing and c@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing and what percentage is on your hands .
some of the po@@ or@@ er countries that have had the most experience with h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 have built up sto@@ ck@@ pil@@ es ; they &apos;re already ex@@ pi@@ red . they are already out of date .
and i think even those in the leadership would say that is the case , that we still have a long ways to go .
happy to take your questions .
and our centers for disease control has l@@ ab@@ el@@ ed a test they developed a ra@@ p@@ id di@@ ag@@ no@@ stic .
and so far in the h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 cases in people , si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al in@@ fe@@ ction has not been an issue at all .
pay attention to not only how fun this thing is , but also how the por@@ t@@ ability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like san francisco .
so please join me for a minute of silence .
i be@@ friend a young ju@@ g@@ gl@@ er in a ju@@ g@@ gl@@ ing tr@@ ou@@ pe , and he ag@@ re@@ es to sell me three c@@ lu@@ bs .
now i have been playing with ro@@ p@@ es and climbing all my childhood , so that &apos;s it . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m becoming a wire wal@@ ker .
manhattan no longer sp@@ re@@ ads its in@@ fin@@ ity .
so you don &apos;t want me to street ju@@ g@@ g@@ le here , right ?
i stop in the middle .
they had become one , pushing me to tri@@ um@@ ph .
because of the over@@ hanging leaves and br@@ an@@ ches , you &apos;ll notice that the under@@ story is very dark , it &apos;s very still .
i was interested , and my can@@ op@@ y res@@ ear@@ cher colleagues have been interested in the dynamics of the can@@ op@@ y plants that live in the forest .
we con@@ su@@ lt to the media about can@@ op@@ y questions ; we have a can@@ op@@ y new@@ sle@@ t@@ ter ; we have an email li@@ st@@ ser@@ v .
and then the students would come into our sound stu@@ di@@ os , they would make their own ra@@ p songs with their own be@@ ats .
and our new project is having the in@@ ma@@ tes and ourselves learn how to raise the or@@ e@@ g@@ on spo@@ tt@@ ed frog which is a highly en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed am@@ p@@ hi@@ bi@@ an in washington state and or@@ e@@ g@@ on .
&quot; look what they &apos;ve been hi@@ ding from you , &quot; he said .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re seeing increasingly this demand for access to information .
they &apos;re not magic . they are not our parents .
you have to trust me . take it on faith . &quot;
i learned two really important things that day .
now , the deeper you go underwater , the higher the pressure is .
so , this is how i began , about 15 years ago .
when you ex@@ hal@@ e your breath , it goes in the ex@@ hal@@ e counter@@ lung : when you in@@ hal@@ e a breath , it comes from the in@@ hal@@ e counter@@ lung .
any one of those computers can run the entire system , so if you have to lose two of them , there &apos;s also back@@ -up power supp@@ lies .
but this is what it looks like , and this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles .
so sharks aren &apos;t quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be .
when we first found it , we weren &apos;t even sure what family this thing bel@@ on@@ ged to , so we just called it the dr. se@@ us@@ s fish , because it looked like something out of one of those books .
he had an oxygen to@@ x@@ ic@@ ity s@@ ei@@ z@@ ure and he dro@@ w@@ ned .
which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ mental disorder .
and his communication and social interaction were im@@ pro@@ ved so dramatically that he was en@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ed into a regular school and even became a kar@@ ate super ch@@ am@@ p .
it &apos;s something like life , that once you get in it you can &apos;t get out .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him , but just mark this day that someday you will hear of him , because he &apos;s really an amazing man . &quot;
n@@ k : no , he &apos;s been dead for 25 years .
he had an enormous amount of love , he loved everybody .
we , all of us , are what happens when a pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al mi@@ x@@ ture of hydrogen and he@@ li@@ um e@@ v@@ ol@@ ves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from .
these ex@@ tre@@ m@@ op@@ h@@ il@@ es tell us that life may exist in many other environments .
so , one needs a very deep app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in pre@@ par@@ ing to make contact with life elsewhere in the co@@ smo@@ s .
it &apos;s making silicon as important as al@@ um@@ in@@ um , and we &apos;ll grow it in the future by adding more an@@ ten@@ n@@ as to reach 3@@ 50 for more sen@@ si@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty and le@@ ver@@ aging mo@@ ore &apos;s law for more processing cap@@ ability .
and then , we &apos;d like to au@@ g@@ ment the au@@ to@@ ma@@ ted search with human insight .
it is the best place on the planet , many say , to study the history of climate change .
each cy@@ lin@@ der is a par@@ fa@@ it of time .
as they handle the ice , in fact , they keep an extra pair of g@@ lo@@ ves warming in an o@@ v@@ en , so that , when their work g@@ lo@@ ves fre@@ e@@ ze and their fingers sti@@ ff@@ en , they can don a fresh pair .
now , a bit of economic history , i think , may be h@@ el@@ p@@ ful here .
and our military get quite un@@ happy with having to stand gu@@ ard on pi@@ p@@ el@@ ines in far@@ -@@ o@@ ff@@ -@@ i@@ st@@ an when what they actually signed up for was to protect american citizens .
then you can go even further , almost tri@@ pl@@ ing efficiency with some op@@ er@@ a@@ tional im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ents , double the big h@@ au@@ l@@ ers &apos; mar@@ g@@ ins .
we could make cars bigger , which is prote@@ ctive , but make them light .
but they &apos;ll sell it to japan and china instead , because we have t@@ ari@@ ff bar@@ ri@@ ers to protect our corn farmers , and they don &apos;t .
that in creating the move to high-@@ volume , low-@@ cost commercial production of these kinds of materials , or for that matter , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ light ste@@ els that are a good back@@ up technology , the military can do the trick it did in turning dar@@ pan@@ et into the internet .
it can &apos;t just be a giant se@@ x@@ ist con@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ cy .
there are really two kinds of negative re@@ vi@@ e@@ ws that we &apos;ve received .
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s really stable .
o@@ op@@ s , i turned the wrong way .
so he finally found an art de@@ al@@ er , a du@@ t@@ ch art de@@ al@@ er named h@@ an van me@@ e@@ g@@ er@@ en , who sold him a wonderful ver@@ me@@ er for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars .
according to his bio@@ gra@@ ph@@ er , &quot; he looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world . &quot;
well , a good answer is , &quot; it depends . what is it ? &quot;
but how at@@ tra@@ ctive you find them , how se@@ x@@ u@@ ally or ro@@ man@@ tically moved you are by them , re@@ sts cri@@ tically on who you think you &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .
but i don &apos;t want a du@@ p@@ li@@ c@@ ate , even if i can &apos;t tell the difference .
so he got jo@@ sh@@ u@@ a bell to take his million dollar vi@@ o@@ li@@ n down to a washington d@@ .@@ c. subway station and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make .
the second shock feels less painful , because you get a bit used to it .
and as you start to read on , you can see that maybe there &apos;s some kind of political val@@ ence behind some of this .
she also bo@@ a@@ sts that she &apos;s a c@@ er@@ ti@@ fied professional member of the american as@@ soci@@ ation of nu@@ tri@@ tional con@@ su@@ l@@ tan@@ ts , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat ve@@ g and o@@ live oil have fewer skin w@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ l@@ es .
the pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o effect is one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine .
and it &apos;s a for@@ e@@ g@@ one conclusion , if you give a drug at that high a do@@ se , that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem that is currently lac@@ king a solution .
and pretty soon , they began shi@@ pping that coal , ton by ton , ra@@ il car by ra@@ il car , bo@@ at@@ load by bo@@ at@@ load , back to china and elsewhere around the world .
can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes ?
it &apos;s all about oil ; you know that , everybody knows that .
there &apos;s this thing , this mi@@ li@@ t@@ ari@@ zation of the world , and it &apos;s c@@ en@@ tered right in the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans .
man , the americans , they &apos;re just like , &quot; ah , cr@@ us@@ a@@ de .
these ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ ans are nu@@ ts .
you &apos;re gener@@ ali@@ zing . it &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and everybody else is chinese .
can you imagine that maybe one of them in the morning b@@ ent down to their child and hu@@ g@@ ged their child and said , &quot; de@@ ar , i &apos;ll be back later .
everything has changed .
now all of this has been tremendous for the world .
thomas je@@ ff@@ er@@ son , i think , really ex@@ pres@@ sed this quite well .
for the hollywood people in the audience , this even explains why action movies have larger bu@@ d@@ gets than com@@ e@@ dies : it &apos;s because action movies translate easier into other languages and other cultures , so the market for those movies is larger .
but it is going to happen in this century .
that &apos;s not u.s. gdp per capita , which will be over a million , but world gdp per capita -- $ 20@@ 0@@ ,000 .
mor@@ e@@ over , as everyone knows , look -- it &apos;s energy , not oil , which co@@ un@@ ts .
my choice is the cul@@ min@@ ation of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the gulf coast of al@@ ab@@ am@@ a , on the fl@@ ori@@ da pen@@ in@@ su@@ la .
we are living on a planet with a lot of activities , with reference to our living environment , done by faith and guess alone .
each has per@@ si@@ sted for thousands to millions of years .
we need to se@@ tt@@ le down before we w@@ re@@ ck the planet .
e@@ .@@ o@@ . wil@@ son : my wish : build the en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ a of life

my grandmother was a hom@@ e@@ ma@@ ker .
and i &apos;d make my own com@@ ics too , and this was another way for me to tell stories , through words and through pictures .
and we sat in silence for that brief moment , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really t@@ al@@ ent@@ ed . &quot;
celebrate your own style . don &apos;t draw the way you &apos;re being told to draw .
&quot; de@@ ar j@@ ar@@ re@@ t@@ t , i received your post@@ card .

this is a 3@@ 2@@ -@@ m@@ il@@ li@@ on-@@ po@@ un@@ d fla@@ g@@ ship ac@@ a@@ de@@ my school which was built quite recently in the u.k. and designed by one of britain &apos;s top architects .
it &apos;s not just the children who are affected , though .
people who say , don &apos;t sit that team next to this team , because they like noise and they need quiet .
&quot; up@@ wake &quot; tells the story of zero , a mo@@ der@@ n-@@ day business man , going to work with his life in a su@@ it@@ case , stuck between dream and reality and not able to de@@ ci@@ ph@@ er the two .

it is now that we can use the diversity of our t@@ al@@ ents to create intelligent , meaningful and extraordinary work . it &apos;s now .
then if you look around you in the ba@@ th@@ room , you see lots more products like sh@@ am@@ po@@ o , con@@ di@@ ti@@ on@@ er , anti-@@ w@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ le cre@@ am , body lo@@ tion , but also to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ st@@ e .
in@@ je@@ ct@@ able col@@ la@@ g@@ en -- or , since the &apos; 70s , col@@ la@@ g@@ en from p@@ ig@@ s -- has been used for in@@ je@@ cting into w@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ l@@ es .
in total , i found 18@@ 5 products .
and i said to her , &quot; well , your year is going to be long and ar@@ du@@ ous , de@@ ar . &quot;
and i gave them a saying to say : &quot; i am somebody .
you made me feel like i was somebody , when i knew , at the bottom , i wasn &apos;t .
they &apos;re now working on their n@@ in@@ th edi@@ tion , which they began in 19@@ 30 , and they &apos;ve reached the letter p@@ .
hundreds of ver@@ bs can go both ways .
you can think of this as the language of thought , or &quot; m@@ ent@@ al@@ ese . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why are bri@@ b@@ es , po@@ li@@ te re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s , so@@ li@@ c@@ it@@ ations and th@@ re@@ ats so often v@@ ei@@ led ?
one way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like if language -- where it could only be used literally .
and the other puzzle is that i &apos;m actually okay with that .
here &apos;s my argument . does it work ? is it any good ?
it makes it ad@@ ver@@ s@@ ari@@ al . it &apos;s po@@ l@@ ari@@ zing .
what did you gain co@@ g@@ ni@@ tively from con@@ v@@ in@@ cing me ?
all these different ro@@ les . now , can you imagine an argument in which you are the ar@@ gu@@ er , but you &apos;re also in the audience watching yourself argue ?
or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out into the natural world . we &apos;ll come with a design challenge and we find the ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on a@@ da@@ p@@ ters in the natural world , who might inspire us .
that changed everything . from then on , you could not get these engineers back in the boat .
this is the opposite ; this is how we make things .
this is san@@ di@@ a national l@@ ab@@ s .
that &apos;s very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without pl@@ at@@ in@@ um .
it &apos;s not easy , because life uses only a sub@@ set of the elements in the per@@ i@@ o@@ di@@ c table .
sen@@ sing and res@@ po@@ n@@ ding : feedback is a huge thing .
you can &apos;t count what you don &apos;t see .
my first business was a d@@ res@@ s@@ making business i started under the t@@ al@@ i@@ b@@ an .
in south korea and in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , women own nearly half a million fi@@ r@@ ms .
because , as the world economic for@@ um not@@ ed , smaller gender g@@ ap@@ s are directly cor@@ related with increased economic com@@ pe@@ ti@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess .
and all around the world are not ex@@ ce@@ p@@ tions .
for this de@@ light and for this wonder , people re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
i have dropped a b@@ lo@@ b of organic yo@@ g@@ ur@@ t from happy self-@@ ac@@ tu@@ alized local co@@ ws on my co@@ un@@ ter top , and i grab a paper to@@ we@@ l and i want to wi@@ pe it up .
so first , we de@@ mo@@ li@@ s@@ h it .
so what does this mean ?
and as i started looking at them , i was finding that they had hy@@ per@@ -@@ a@@ da@@ p@@ ted .
but the researchers had a problem .
until they finally gra@@ du@@ ated and left cam@@ pu@@ s , and -- g@@ la@@ d to get away , i &apos;m sure -- came back s@@ om@@ e@@ time later , and found the cro@@ ws still re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed them .
we found out they &apos;re really smart , and we found out that they can teach each other .
squ@@ ir@@ rel@@ s , for example , would show up , look for the pe@@ an@@ u@@ t , go away .
but there were three problems , three en@@ ig@@ m@@ as that i could not solve , and i want to share with you those problems , but most importantly , i think i figured out a pro@@ pos@@ al for a solution .
who is ever going to hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what might happen , because every region has something to offer .
let me connect the dots .
they know this is the mass audience of the future ; they need to figure it out .
this is far too si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ stic .
oh , i &apos;m going to be the jo@@ h@@ n@@ ny ap@@ pl@@ es@@ e@@ ed of sound .
there &apos;s about 10 million p@@ ha@@ ge per job .
and over here we have , in the words of radi@@ ologist israel m@@ ei@@ s@@ ner , &quot; the hand gr@@ as@@ ping the pen@@ is in a fashion res@@ em@@ bling ma@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ation movements . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yeah , but you know i &apos;d rather finish my meal if you don &apos;t mind . &quot;
i said to her , &quot; you should do an experiment .
he had this line in his book that su@@ p@@ pos@@ e@@ dly comes from the h@@ ab@@ s@@ bur@@ g mon@@ ar@@ ch@@ y , where there was an em@@ press mar@@ ia ther@@ es@@ a , who was having trouble con@@ c@@ ei@@ ving .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you what she said , because i love it .
this just k@@ il@@ l@@ s me , not because i wanted to use it -- i wanted to see it .
and that &apos;s actually where our story begins .
now up until that moment , i would have thought that , by age 50 , one of the life skills that i had really na@@ iled was t@@ ying my shoes .
first of all , i have to say i &apos;m not from around here .
yeah . the artist doesn &apos;t really seem to know where to put the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that you &apos;re still a little bit s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ al .
it &apos;s called &quot; un@@ ti@@ t@@ led &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
so after a while i decided to have a little fun , and before leaving the room each day i &apos;d sc@@ at@@ ter a few things around the space .
and now they &apos;re all in here .
my dad was , which is kind of an interesting way to grow up .
the song is just a given .
i went , &quot; wait a minute , all right , right -- i &apos;ll get the wh@@ e@@ els . &quot; pur@@ ely out of pro@@ test , i got the f@@ l@@ as@@ h@@ y wh@@ e@@ els , and i in@@ st@@ al@@ l@@ ed them and -- check this out . could i have my special light cu@@ e please ?
now it seems simple , but actually i think in our society and culture in general , we have a huge problem with in@@ t@@ ent .
pro@@ b@@ es he designed , and in fact , he was really , really proud of these pro@@ b@@ es .
man , i love that thing .
the consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and co@@ un@@ ting .
he was particularly proud of the comfortable seat , really comfortable seat he had made in his ch@@ ari@@ o@@ t and its beautiful f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c f@@ r@@ in@@ ge around the edge .
in@@ t@@ ent -- a life with in@@ t@@ ent -- lived by design , co@@ ver@@ ing the original with something better .
i saw the healthy bul@@ k of a left del@@ to@@ id , and i m@@ ou@@ r@@ ned that it was lost , m@@ ou@@ r@@ ned all i had not yet done , but was now impossible .
i then began to wonder , as i had many times before , how my life would have been different had this man not in@@ ju@@ red me , had my genes been fed a different helping of experience .
i was me , but i was now me despite a li@@ m@@ p , and that , i suppose , was what now made me , me .
i &apos;d h@@ op@@ ed for something si@@ m@@ pl@@ er : to exchange a tur@@ k@@ ish des@@ s@@ er@@ t for two words and be on my way .
he &apos;d served six months in prison , lost his truck license for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine perception laboratory at the u@@ .@@ c. san di@@ e@@ go .
one , the perception of people , and two , the natural interface , the natural form of the interface , so that it &apos;s more intuitive for you to interact with the robot .
and yet , i &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own .
so having seen this danger to the economy , i thought , we need to find a solution to this problem .
or some even in@@ c@@ lu@@ ded re@@ fer@@ en@@ ces to the speakers , such as na@@ than my@@ h@@ r@@ v@@ old &apos;s speaking style , or the one of ti@@ m fer@@ ris@@ s , which might be considered a bit st@@ r@@ en@@ u@@ ous at times .
i don &apos;t know any te@@ d@@ talk that contains this .
this time i paid 25 cents because i thought the task was a bit harder .
but even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : the ex@@ pan@@ sion must be s@@ lo@@ wing down .
so hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as i now go on to tell you three key things about string theory .
the list of can@@ di@@ date shapes has so@@ ar@@ ed to about 10 to the 500 .
and he worked for decades trying to explain this number , but he never su@@ c@@ ce@@ e@@ ded , and we know why .
each of these uni@@ ver@@ ses has extra dimensions .
because today &apos;s a@@ st@@ r@@ on@@ om@@ ers , by turning powerful t@@ el@@ es@@ c@@ op@@ es to the sky , have cap@@ tu@@ red a hand@@ ful of star@@ k@@ ly in@@ for@@ ma@@ tive ph@@ ot@@ ons -- a kind of co@@ s@@ mic tele@@ gram billions of years in trans@@ it .
now , i &apos;ll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick , but it &apos;s a trick that actually works .
so remember , this is the first time you &apos;ve met him , and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious .
he said , &quot; go on , m@@ il@@ o . squ@@ ash it . &quot;
p@@ m : that &apos;s di@@ mit@@ r@@ i at his most com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive .
we don &apos;t know anyone .
the next thing , the tele@@ phones go out , the t@@ v@@ s go out , there &apos;s ar@@ med men on the street , there &apos;s ro@@ ad@@ blocks .
it was a very s@@ om@@ ber gathering of the re@@ por@@ ters that worked there during the war , hu@@ man@@ it@@ ari@@ an aid workers , and of course the bra@@ ve and c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ge@@ ous people of s@@ ar@@ a@@ je@@ v@@ o themselves .
so when people ask me how i continue to cover war , and why i continue to do it , this is why .
but my m@@ é@@ ti@@ er is to bear wi@@ t@@ ness and that is the cru@@ x , the heart of the matter , for us re@@ por@@ ters who do this .
so even before a target appears that she &apos;s supposed to cross with the cur@@ s@@ or that she &apos;s controlling with this jo@@ y@@ stick , au@@ r@@ or@@ a is trying to find the target , no matter where it is .
and what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these a@@ v@@ at@@ ars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world .
well , in an experiment that we ran a few years ago , we took this to the li@@ mit .
so , let &apos;s start off in china .
so da@@ i man@@ j@@ u basically finished out middle school .
hands up , please .
the last reason has to do with women being part of the solution , not the problem .
in ni@@ ger , one in seven women can expect to die during ch@@ il@@ d@@ birth .
she has become part of the solution , not the problem .
l@@ ar@@ ry su@@ m@@ m@@ ers , when he was chief economist at the world bank , once said that , &quot; it may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls &apos; education . &quot;
there &apos;s bill e@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ ly &apos;s book .
what that was was a bird fe@@ e@@ der .
now all this f@@ us@@ s about a single one of our tra@@ its tells us there &apos;s something worth explaining .
and even this picture has the s@@ us@@ pi@@ ci@@ ous ta@@ in@@ t of being ri@@ g@@ ged about it -- something from a bar@@ n@@ um &amp; amp ; ba@@ i@@ ley ci@@ r@@ c@@ us .
one of those options was that we could have re@@ treated into small family groups .
you put down your ar@@ ro@@ wh@@ e@@ ads and say , &quot; i &apos;d like to trade these ar@@ ro@@ wh@@ e@@ ads for finished ar@@ ro@@ ws . i &apos;ll split you 50 / 50 . &quot;
there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language every two or three miles .
if 27 individuals from those 27 member states sat around table , speaking their 23 languages , some very simple mathematics will tell you that you need an army of 2@@ 5@@ 3 trans@@ lat@@ ors to anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te all the pa@@ ir@@ wise possibilities .
but that doesn &apos;t tell us they necessarily had language .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its ac@@ comp@@ an@@ ying image , and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image .
these are trans@@ atlantic sub@@ marine communication c@@ ab@@ les that travel across the floor of the atlantic ocean , connecting north america to europe .
they flip the negative .
but through ex@@ pos@@ ure to com@@ pos@@ i@@ te sk@@ et@@ ches , po@@ l@@ ar@@ o@@ i@@ ds , mu@@ g sh@@ ots and lin@@ e-@@ u@@ ps , e@@ ye@@ wi@@ t@@ ness te@@ st@@ im@@ on@@ y can change .
l@@ ar@@ ry yo@@ un@@ g@@ blood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence in ari@@ z@@ on@@ a for the ab@@ du@@ ction and re@@ pe@@ ated so@@ d@@ om@@ i@@ zing of a 10 year old boy at a car@@ ni@@ val .
before that time , people are left to their own devices .
and they actually shi@@ pped them here to texas for us .
and now you &apos;re ri@@ ding along with the is@@ s where it is right now .
it &apos;s just the va@@ st@@ ness of space makes it look like nothing &apos;s happening .
this is called ho@@ o@@ ked on a feeling : the pur@@ suit of happiness and human design .
in part , we have the legacy of fre@@ u@@ d , who was a p@@ es@@ si@@ m@@ ist , who said that pur@@ suit of happiness is a do@@ om@@ ed quest , is pro@@ p@@ elled by in@@ f@@ an@@ ti@@ le as@@ pe@@ cts of the individual that can never be met in reality .
and one of the key points in the science of happiness is that happiness and un@@ happiness are not end@@ points of a single con@@ tin@@ u@@ um .
and it starts in the v@@ ent@@ ra@@ l te@@ g@@ mental area .
here is a three-@@ we@@ e@@ k-@@ old baby .
now in the animal world , there is only one way to increase status , and that &apos;s d@@ om@@ in@@ ance .
i end with a few qu@@ ot@@ es .
why would you choose r@@ at@@ s ?
once the animal knows this , we make the task a bit more difficult .
you can actually cure t@@ .@@ b@@ . , even in hi@@ v@@ -@@ pos@@ i@@ ti@@ ves .
knowing that a missed patient by micro@@ sc@@ op@@ y in@@ fe@@ cts up to 15 people , healthy people , per year , you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives .
we &apos;re looking at neurons here .
so , this is important for im@@ it@@ ation and e@@ mu@@ lation .
now , the question then ar@@ is@@ es : if i simply watch another person being touched , why do i not get con@@ f@@ used and literally feel that touch sen@@ sa@@ tion mer@@ ely by watching somebody being touched ?
thank you . i have two mis@@ sions here today .
my story is actually not about plant pro@@ pa@@ g@@ ation , but about pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken with a sc@@ an@@ ning el@@ e@@ c@@ tr@@ on microscope , actually in the lab at ke@@ w l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies .
each of us , in fact , with a story to tell from the pollen f@@ ing@@ er@@ print that &apos;s upon us .
we need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis .
and right around that time , in the 19@@ 80 &apos;s , that we saw women and heart disease deaths going up , up , up , up , up , she wrote an edi@@ t@@ ori@@ al in the new england j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ al of medicine and said , the y@@ ent@@ l sy@@ n@@ dro@@ me .
and our colleagues in washington , d@@ .@@ c.
so we said , &quot; let &apos;s look at these . &quot;
so unlike the cat sc@@ ans , x@@ -@@ ra@@ ys , th@@ al@@ li@@ um@@ s , for women whose breast is in the way of looking at the heart , every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation , we say , &quot; do we really need that test ? &quot;
okay , so here &apos;s where we started .
they have put their money where their mouth is and they have done ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ac@@ y and they have joined cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ns .
the cells are kind of hom@@ es@@ ic@@ k ; the dish doesn &apos;t feel like their home .
what does this mean for us ?
over the course of three years , we recorded eight to 10 hours a day , a@@ mas@@ sing roughly a quar@@ ter@@ -@@ million hours of multi@@ -@@ track au@@ di@@ o and video .
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .
and finally , my son playing in a walking to@@ y by himself .
three of the key people in this project , p@@ hi@@ li@@ p de@@ c@@ amp , r@@ on@@ y ku@@ b@@ at and br@@ and@@ on ro@@ y are p@@ ic@@ tu@@ red here .
and there are fascinating dynamics at play .
this is the first time our son took more than two steps at once -- cap@@ tu@@ red on film .
and this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning , the better we can communicate , and , i also think , the better we can think and c@@ ol@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ ate together .
it &apos;s the kind of gut center , where you see an image and you go , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever i &apos;m seeing . &quot;
what we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire st@@ r@@ at@@ e@@ gi@@ c plan on one giant wall .
this is the first house i built .
after all , it &apos;s not just a question of hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , but there &apos;s a possibility of re@@ creation as well .
so don &apos;t put it there .
so you translate that to the building industry , if we have a wall of win@@ do@@ w@@ pan@@ es and one pan@@ e is cra@@ cked , we go , &quot; oh , de@@ ar . that &apos;s cra@@ cked . let &apos;s repair it .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we hi@@ red on .
are we just being nu@@ m@@ b@@ ingly stupid ?
you can s@@ na@@ p through it in maybe two years if you read eight hours a day .
so along about september they can stri@@ de in and go , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
what don &apos;t you do this , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police are waiting for the fire department to ar@@ ri@@ ve to cut apart the vehicle to extract the body of the driver .
and that comes down right way to the present with the dollar bill in the united states , which has on it an eye of pro@@ vi@@ den@@ ce .
all of this is leading -- computer ad@@ di@@ ction , just to cover that : the most fre@@ qu@@ ent thing we do is use digital devices .
that is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the st@@ ro@@ ke .
this is a very , very low level in order to be ki@@ cked out of the health care system .
he then held my ja@@ w in the right position while or@@ th@@ o@@ don@@ tically he put my teeth into correct al@@ ig@@ n@@ ment .
al@@ fre@@ d m@@ an@@ n is a brilliant physicist and in@@ no@@ v@@ ator who &apos;s fascinated with bri@@ d@@ ging g@@ ap@@ s in consciousness , whether to re@@ store hearing to the de@@ a@@ f , vision to the blind or movement to the par@@ al@@ y@@ zed .
now in the dark years that followed , i had to work out what re@@ ma@@ ined for me if everything that made today special was gone .
and it works . it works .
l@@ p : so when you get a chance , spend some time with si@@ m@@ on .
and these were the developing countries : they had large families and they had relatively short lives .
and they are over here on this side . quite an over@@ la@@ p between africa and o@@ e@@ c@@ d .
and then den@@ g x@@ i@@ a@@ op@@ ing came and brought money to china , and brought them into the ma@@ in@@ stream again .
a search function where we can copy the data up to a se@@ ar@@ ch@@ able for@@ m@@ at and get it out in the world . and what do we hear when we go around ?
but this is hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is@@ -@@ gener@@ ating .
you know , darwin explained life after it got started , but what was the essence of life ?
and there i met f@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ is cri@@ ck .
but there was ones in the literature .
we weren &apos;t the best che@@ mi@@ sts in the room .
i was de@@ ci@@ de@@ dly un@@ happy ; a girl didn &apos;t mar@@ ry me .
and what you can do is sort of compare dna of normal se@@ gs versus cancer .
and so , i &apos;ll conclude by saying we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with s@@ ch@@ i@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ ia .
you need to know that the average patent tro@@ l@@ l defense costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
first of all , if you can , don &apos;t fight the patent , fight the in@@ f@@ r@@ in@@ ge@@ ment .
my solution : a@@ ward me this patent and i will tro@@ l@@ l them out of existence .
&quot; why not ? &quot; the girls asked .
fathers were in a space where they were able to make their d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters play , and pull out her chair and ex@@ tend his hand for a dance .
this is a great technology .
there &apos;s not very much left in the world .
it can &apos;t live for a very long time in people .
so you can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and as a result , we &apos;ve needed a very different approach to er@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ate polio than what was done with smallpox .
it &apos;s been working to help control pan@@ de@@ mic flu , s@@ ars for example .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : well br@@ u@@ ce , where do you think the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ est places are going to be ?
br@@ u@@ ce a@@ y@@ l@@ ward : how we &apos;ll stop polio for good
d@@ j : now we &apos;ve found these indi@@ vi@@ du@@ al@@ is@@ ms in all sorts of animals , in particular in the cats .
and sur@@ pris@@ ingly , it became a cul@@ t film .
and for us , in many ways , this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us , a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work .
it was absolutely amazing when she picked it up to safety , protecting it from the hy@@ en@@ a .
and of course , looking at this li@@ on pa@@ w that has been sk@@ in@@ n@@ ed , it e@@ er@@ i@@ ly re@@ minds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ir@@ on@@ ic , because their fa@@ te is in our hands .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman , as a community and as part of this planet , and we need to continue that .
after all , it seems obvious that the earth is large and mo@@ ti@@ on@@ less , the sun small and mobile . but it &apos;s worth re@@ calling wi@@ tt@@ gen@@ st@@ ei@@ n &apos;s re@@ mark on the subject .
and that &apos;s because in middle world , air fri@@ ction is always there .
the nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are .
because there are so many of them , and because there &apos;s no ag@@ re@@ em@@ ent among them in their pre@@ fer@@ red direction of movement , the mar@@ ble , as we see it in middle world , sta@@ ys rock ste@@ ad@@ y .
treating people as machines may be s@@ ci@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ cally and p@@ hi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ hi@@ cally accurate , but it &apos;s a c@@ um@@ ber@@ some waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next .
over@@ night , i became a mu@@ te qu@@ ad@@ ri@@ ple@@ gi@@ c at the ri@@ pe old age of 40 .
using a mouse cur@@ s@@ or i control with my head , these web inter@@ faces allow me to see video from the robot and send control com@@ m@@ and@@ s by pres@@ sing bu@@ tt@@ ons in a web bro@@ w@@ s@@ er .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream a reality .
for example , in o@@ ce@@ an@@ o@@ graphy , a le@@ x@@ ic@@ on of dolphin language is actually being created by basically vis@@ u@@ ali@@ zing the son@@ ar be@@ am@@ s that the dolphins e@@ mit .
i think col@@ le@@ c@@ tively we can build a global community .
it &apos;s been a major tr@@ en@@ ding topic .
now there &apos;s a couple -- there &apos;s a couple of lessons that you can take from this .
but generally speaking , most of us don &apos;t .
i think that we tend to look a lot at the infrastructure of globalization .
that &apos;s down to about 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we have to solve .
i &apos;m also gu@@ es@@ s@@ ing that most of you don &apos;t even speak chinese -- which is sort of sad if you think about it , as it &apos;s now the most represented language on the internet .
what are they looking at ? maybe we should be looking at it .
and when you look at this image , you might find yourself going , &quot; why would i con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ ably care about this ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find your place within it .
they would bring pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ity , security , overcome se@@ ct@@ ari@@ an violence , en@@ sure that states would never again har@@ b@@ or ter@@ r@@ ori@@ sts .
and part of that activity is h@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ y .
what is this ?
i love this dish .
and caused the war that killed 20 million people -- still the de@@ ad@@ li@@ est civil war in the world to this day .
le@@ m s@@ en , who &apos;s this guy : i would have made this money , too , but i &apos;ve spent all this time looking for the american man who sto@@ le my re@@ ci@@ pe .
chinese re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts have done largely the same thing , i would argue , with the men@@ u and the d@@ é@@ c@@ or -- even the restaurant name -- but without a c@@ ent@@ r@@ alized head@@ quar@@ ters .
in contrast , we have general t@@ so &apos;s chicken , which actually started in new york city in the early 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s , as i was also starting in the university in new york city in the early 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s , so ...
so what we see in the se@@ v@@ ent@@ e@@ ent@@ h , ei@@ gh@@ te@@ ent@@ h century is the continued search for medi@@ ca@@ tions other than cam@@ ph@@ or that &apos;ll do the trick .
so people would have a real grand ma@@ l s@@ ei@@ z@@ ure .
as my re@@ fer@@ r@@ als began to de@@ cre@@ ase , i clearly became increasingly depressed until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
remember when you were a kid , and you had to step on every line ?
by 18 and 19 , i was sleeping through the night .
every once in a while , i get somewhat depressed and a little ob@@ s@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al .
there is so much to do over the next few years that is obvious to so many of us to build a better world .
and he &apos;s going around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know ? where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew ar@@ o@@ se from the potential for ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ es , as well as the potential for climate change ?
by tac@@ k@@ l@@ ing the impossible , you make the impossible possible .
but we did get an ag@@ re@@ em@@ ent on climate change .
and god cri@@ ed .
the silk wor@@ m does a remarkable thing : it uses these two ingredients , protein and water , that are in its gl@@ and , to make a material that is ex@@ ce@@ p@@ ti@@ on@@ ally tough for protection -- so com@@ par@@ able to technical fi@@ ber@@ s like k@@ e@@ v@@ l@@ ar .
or you can do beautiful things that , if the camera can capture , you can make .
and you see there , it gets rein@@ te@@ gr@@ ated in tissue .
with my new v@@ ent@@ ure , mar@@ il@@ y@@ n mon@@ robot , i would like to use art to create tech .
there &apos;s also a micro@@ phone that &apos;s listening to the ag@@ gre@@ gate l@@ au@@ gh@@ ter and ap@@ pl@@ au@@ se and bo@@ o@@ ing -- i hope not -- to help make some of its next decisions .
what can i do ? &quot;
in this fi@@ r@@ st-@@ o@@ f@@ -@@ it@@ s-@@ kind de@@ m@@ o , hea@@ ther k@@ night in@@ tro@@ du@@ ces data , a robotic st@@ and@@ -up com@@ edi@@ an that does much more than r@@ at@@ t@@ le off one-@@ lin@@ ers -- it ga@@ th@@ ers audience feedback and t@@ un@@ es its act as the crowd res@@ po@@ n@@ ds . is this thing on ?
st@@ an@@ ley m@@ il@@ gram from the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , the cre@@ ator of the s@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ -@@ world experiments , which became later po@@ p@@ ul@@ ari@@ zed as six degrees of se@@ par@@ ation , made the point that any two ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ari@@ ly s@@ el@@ e@@ cted people were likely connected from between five to seven inter@@ medi@@ ary steps .
how might we think differently about our rel@@ a@@ tions with distributed groups of people ?
there was , however , an in@@ ci@@ dent i &apos;m going to tell you about , that perhaps could have led me s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct something .
my father , a secret ag@@ ent ?
it was my grandfather who decided they needed false do@@ c@@ um@@ ents .
this sense of responsibility for other people &apos;s lives when he was just 17 -- and also his gu@@ il@@ t for being a sur@@ vi@@ v@@ or , since he had es@@ cap@@ ed the camp when his friends had not -- stayed with him all his life .
and while my half brother and sister thought they &apos;d been ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed , or@@ ph@@ an@@ ed , my father was making false papers .
i asked him whether , con@@ si@@ der@@ ing the s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ces he had to make , he ever had any re@@ gre@@ ts .
we go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today .
the arctic -- a beautiful system -- a re@@ g@@ ul@@ ating bi@@ om@@ e at the pl@@ an@@ et@@ ary level , taking the k@@ no@@ ck after k@@ no@@ ck on climate change , ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing to be in a good state .
you de@@ grade forests , you go beyond the bo@@ un@@ dar@@ y on land , you under@@ mine the ability of the climate system to stay stable .
under the re@@ ali@@ zation from t@@ ou@@ r@@ ist op@@ er@@ ators , f@@ is@@ her@@ men , the au@@ st@@ r@@ ali@@ an great bar@@ ri@@ er reef authority and scientists that the great bar@@ ri@@ er reef is do@@ om@@ ed under the current governance re@@ gi@@ me .
but of course , the dra@@ ma is , it clearly shows that in@@ cre@@ mental change is not an option .
that led me to another step of why i &apos;m here today , is because i really liked media of all kinds .
is a re@@ m@@ n@@ ant of a race of -- a very evolved race of en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ers .
first , he got an a@@ ge@@ -@@ old way of making it , which was re@@ li@@ e@@ f , and he worked this with three-@@ point perspective , which was br@@ and@@ -@@ new technology at the time .
and by man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ating sugar over a black paper , i made por@@ tra@@ its of them .
they end up being very large pictures , and i photographed with a very large camera -- an 8@@ x@@ 10 camera .
my interest in acting , especially bad acting , goes a long way .
far@@ ther back is there one shared with chimpanzees .
but we can then ask : are there any absolute differences between africans and non-@@ africans ?
and you can begin to compare it to the gen@@ om@@ es of people who live today .
so we can then ask for den@@ is@@ o@@ v@@ ans the same things as for the ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ als : did they mix with ancestors of present day people ?
there are a lot of people who created their own vision about the future , for instance , this vision here from the early 20th century .
my belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness .
so imagine you have carbon n@@ an@@ ot@@ u@@ b@@ es growing inside a 3d pr@@ in@@ ter , and they are embedded inside a ma@@ tri@@ x of plastic , and follow the forces which occur in your component .
they didn &apos;t talk . but most of all , they were ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ari@@ ly is@@ ol@@ ated from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
you would re@@ co@@ il . you would call the police .
well , now we know it &apos;s more like one in 100 .
you &apos;re watching a video .
there is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on re@@ ali@@ ties , pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing , in fact , those experiences that i really started in my journey in this field .
then you take off .
the first thing you do is lo@@ ck into a ti@@ g@@ h@@ t body position -- head down in your chest , your arms ex@@ ten@@ ded , put over your res@@ er@@ ve par@@ ach@@ ute .
they &apos;d be doing everything that we had taught them .
and after the battle , they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an &quot; after action review &quot; to teach you what you &apos;ve done wrong .
also , the people had changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this isn &apos;t easy stuff .
and she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how pro@@ b@@ le@@ matic this image was , as it related , for her , to the idea of how black people had been represented .
it is really in this sense of discovery that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m asking .
well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement up there .
so the children said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
they are trying to multi@@ p@@ ly , i think .
so i said , &quot; well , how long did you practice on it before you decided you understood nothing ? &quot;
the sc@@ or@@ es went up to 50 , which is what the pos@@ h schools of new del@@ hi , with a trained bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ gy teacher were getting .
when i did the experiment , when i did the test , after two months , the score was 7@@ 6 percent .
after watching eight te@@ d@@ talks , he wants to become le@@ on@@ ar@@ do da v@@ in@@ c@@ i .
these are 10 year-olds .
and all of a sudden , out of the dark , from the other end of the square , i saw the gl@@ in@@ t of mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors li@@ t by the moon .
if i were to reduce this entire story into one image , what would it be ? &quot;
so now i &apos;m going to show you some cli@@ ps from the other big project of my life this year , &quot; the te@@ m@@ p@@ est . &quot;
and our little life is ro@@ und@@ ed with a sleep .
bon@@ o : they &apos;re my@@ th@@ ol@@ o@@ gi@@ es .
i know you understand that .
so , blue , blue , everything became blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of them are in africa .
it &apos;s another one that lives at the con@@ flu@@ ence of health and en@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise .
let &apos;s use the market as the best listening device we have , and understand at what price people would pay for this , so they get the dignity of choice .
thank you .
the rule of th@@ um@@ b was that , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two pi@@ an@@ os and 10 t@@ el@@ e@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ ons in the process .
the little one had a ten@@ den@@ cy to try to run off the track and that &apos;s a problem .
that one &apos;s pretty good . it &apos;s getting better .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models i work with .
gener@@ ating ti@@ s@@ su@@ es of pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able density and behavior is the second piece , and will be really key towards getting these models to be ad@@ op@@ ted for drug discovery .
thank you .
trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an ar@@ row with the fe@@ a@@ ther@@ ed end forward . it was a tough job , and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature .
but now let &apos;s look at the other end .
we &apos;re working on projects now -- even w@@ ing-@@ fla@@ pping things the size of ha@@ w@@ k mo@@ ths -- dar@@ p@@ a contra@@ cts , working with cal@@ tech , u@@ cl@@ a .
so , be g@@ ent@@ le , just act like a wo@@ o@@ den indian or something .
now i wasn &apos;t trying to be smart .
they keep going on forever .
it &apos;s over two billion .
it took him , by his estimate , &quot; three years of sun@@ days . &quot;
don &apos;t forget to sub@@ tra@@ ct the one .
but for me it &apos;s amazing because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time in which we live , when human minds and machines can con@@ qu@@ er together .
i &apos;ve clearly got mass . where does it come from ?
and in fact , there &apos;s concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ed that this devil cancer was spread by a virus .
so i took this opportunity to collect some samples from j@@ on@@ as &apos; tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body .
she took him to the v@@ et and the v@@ et discovered something quite dis@@ gu@@ sting .
so just finally , cancer is an ine@@ vi@@ table outcome of the ability of our cells to divide and to adapt to their environments .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
they were willing to pay extra in order to wait .
and that is the third reason why lo@@ w@@ er@@ ing your ex@@ pe@@ c@@ tations will not make you happy .
but they didn &apos;t think that those numbers were related to them .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you the average amount of bias that we see .
but the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias does not sh@@ at@@ ter the illusion .
what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia gra@@ du@@ ally re@@ turning to being more than half of the world &apos;s population and more than half of the world &apos;s product .
you might think of that as the pri@@ va@@ ti@@ zation of war .
in 19@@ 5@@ 8 , after the so@@ vi@@ ets put up sp@@ u@@ t@@ ni@@ k , it was &quot; that &apos;s the end of america . &quot;
if you &apos;re sitting in japan , or in new del@@ hi , or in han@@ o@@ i , your view of the rise of china is a little different than if you &apos;re sitting in b@@ ei@@ j@@ ing .
and if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective , we &apos;re going to be able to manage this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just zero sum , but positive sum .
so that &apos;s the conventional approach .
the security council typically has the responsibility for providing the pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ke@@ e@@ pers who build the security .
and they are inter@@ dependent over a long term .
jobs for whom ? especially jobs for young men .
often the legal system is broken down so you can &apos;t even get access to land .
they would be co-@@ br@@ and@@ ed as being done by the post-@@ conflict government , in the country .
this is the sk@@ y@@ line of my hom@@ et@@ own , new or@@ le@@ ans .
the military gets it . they call climate change a threat multi@@ p@@ li@@ er that could harm st@@ ability and security , while governments around the world are e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ating how to respond .
it &apos;s allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time , without as@@ si@@ st@@ an@@ ce .
i think these are inspiring examples of what &apos;s possible when we feel em@@ powered to plan for a world that will be different .
listen as chinese students practice their english by s@@ cre@@ am@@ ing it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and these include things like clo@@ thing that concrete world with c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ fication , in@@ tro@@ du@@ cing ab@@ stra@@ ctions that we try to make lo@@ gi@@ cally consistent , and also taking the hy@@ po@@ the@@ tic@@ al seriously , that is , wondering about what might have been rather than what is .
lu@@ ri@@ a looked at people just before they entered the scientific age , and he found that these people were resi@@ st@@ ant to c@@ l@@ as@@ si@@ fying the concrete world .
and lu@@ ri@@ a said , &quot; at the north pole , there is always snow .
they put it in al@@ b@@ any rather than new york .
so it hasn &apos;t just been the spread of co@@ g@@ ni@@ tively de@@ m@@ and@@ ing pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ ons .
would you des@@ er@@ ve to be killed ?
they could say a se@@ mi@@ circle .
it feels like i &apos;ve landed in a colony of an@@ g@@ el@@ s . &quot;
and so they ple@@ ad@@ ed with me to get a degree in something .
now it &apos;s still in de@@ b@@ t , but chris has managed , through his own s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce , to get this film out .
i am one of her teaching ge@@ st@@ ur@@ es .
there &apos;s a prime minister , se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary of state , minister of defense and a c@@ f@@ o , or comp@@ tro@@ l@@ l@@ er .
boy : the world peace game is serious .
we were all up@@ set with her , &quot; why are you doing this ?
it &apos;ll be more re@@ al@@ er if she re@@ ads it . &quot;
we had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the inter@@ lo@@ cking c@@ ris@@ es .
and we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
lots of people res@@ ig@@ ned from well-@@ paid jobs and j@@ um@@ ped into the national movement .
it &apos;s like its own little c@@ ou@@ pl@@ ing .
and if i were to po@@ ke all the three legs of this in the three ver@@ tic@@ es of this tri@@ angle , i would make a te@@ tra@@ he@@ dr@@ on .
so all you do is -- it &apos;s a very kind of pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive statement -- this old bicycle tube and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; this fil@@ ling cap will go very s@@ nu@@ g@@ ly into an old bicycle tube .
and this can be , if you had a whole photo@@ copy paper -- a@@ 4 size paper -- you could be in a m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ al school , you could be in a government school -- a paper , a scale and a pen@@ ci@@ l -- no gl@@ u@@ e , no sc@@ is@@ s@@ ors .
what we do is make a very simple electric motor .
this is a little stra@@ w , and what you do is you just ni@@ p two cor@@ ners here , and this becomes like a baby cro@@ co@@ di@@ le &apos;s mouth .
these are two ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ts .
and there were lots of p@@ as@@ sen@@ gers on the ship , and they were getting bor@@ ed , so the cap@@ ta@@ in invited them on the de@@ ck .
at the ink conference , ar@@ v@@ in@@ d gu@@ p@@ t@@ a shares simple yet st@@ un@@ ning plans for turning tr@@ ash into seriously en@@ ter@@ ta@@ in@@ ing , well-@@ designed to@@ ys that kids can build themselves -- while learning basic principles of science and design .
it was a hell of a challenge , and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the c@@ lu@@ es .
and there are some examples of projects that have de@@ li@@ ber@@ at@@ ely tried to mi@@ mic ecosystems .
and with just a little bit of planning , we could transform a space d@@ om@@ in@@ ated by traffic into one that provides open space for people , re@@ con@@ ne@@ cts people with food and trans@@ forms waste into closed loop opportunities .
this photograph was taken on comp@@ le@@ tion day , and just one year later , it looked like that .
when you e@@ v@@ a@@ po@@ rate se@@ a@@ water , the first thing to cr@@ y@@ st@@ al@@ li@@ ze out is cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate .
no , you need to set people &apos;s s@@ ou@@ ls ab@@ la@@ ze with v@@ is@@ i@@ ons of exploring distant sh@@ or@@ es . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who was jewish , because that &apos;s what i am and that was important to me .
but the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date .
very few of us have the ability to be totally and br@@ u@@ t@@ ally honest with ourselves .
he likes to travel as long as it doesn &apos;t in@@ v@@ ol@@ ve a cru@@ ise ship .
what i was trying to get at here was as a s@@ mi@@ le@@ y@@ gi@@ r@@ l@@ 19@@ 7@@ 8 .
because remember , in my sc@@ or@@ ing system , they have to reach a min@@ im@@ um th@@ res@@ hold of 7@@ 0@@ 0 points , and none of them have done that .
most of you . the average age of a gam@@ er is 3@@ 3 years old , not eight years old , and in fact , if we look at the pro@@ je@@ cted de@@ mo@@ graphics of video game play , the video game players of tomorrow are older adults .
guess what ? their vision is really , really good .
actually , those action video game players have many other ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ges in terms of attention , and one aspect of attention which is also im@@ pro@@ ved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world .
now i &apos;d like you to remember that result , and put it in the context of another group of technology users , a group which is actually much re@@ ver@@ ed by society , which are people that engage in multi@@ medi@@ a-@@ t@@ as@@ king .
so let me il@@ lu@@ stra@@ te that step with a task which is called mental ro@@ tation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just run all possible programs of the particular type that we &apos;re looking at .
so , it &apos;s been a big , very complex project , which i was not sure was going to work at all .
so w@@ ol@@ fra@@ m al@@ ph@@ a knows about lots and lots of kinds of things .
on the one hand , we have ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tic@@ a , with its sort of precise , for@@ ma@@ l language and a huge network of carefully designed cap@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties able to get a lot done in just a few lines .
so , with physical materials , we &apos;re used to going around the world and dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ing that particular materials are useful for particular technological pur@@ pos@@ es .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited to discover that there are can@@ di@@ date uni@@ ver@@ ses with incredibly simple rules that successfully re@@ produce special rel@@ a@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty , and even general rel@@ a@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty and gra@@ vi@@ tation , and at least give h@@ in@@ ts of quantum me@@ chan@@ ics .
s@@ w : i think so .
and during that time , i actually lost more rel@@ a@@ ti@@ ves , as well as the teachers who taught me , to hiv / aids .
they jump high . they wear red .
because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any property , and by de@@ f@@ au@@ lt , everything in my family anyway bel@@ on@@ gs to my father , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual c@@ er@@ em@@ on@@ y happens , we were dancing , having ex@@ c@@ it@@ em@@ ent , and through all the night we did not sleep .
they were s@@ ne@@ a@@ k@@ ers , and this is in a village that doesn &apos;t even have pa@@ ved roads . it was quite at@@ tra@@ ctive .
i pro@@ mis@@ ed him that i would be the best girl , i will come back , anything they wanted after that , i will do it for them .
if she got pregnant before she got married , the mother is bl@@ am@@ ed for that , and she &apos;s pun@@ ished .
as we speak right now , 1@@ 25 girls will never be mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated .
consumers who represent 7@@ 2 percent of the gdp of america have actually started , just like ban@@ ks and just like businesses , to de@@ -@@ le@@ ver@@ age , to un@@ wind their le@@ ver@@ age , in daily life , to remove themselves from the li@@ ability and risk that pres@@ ents itself as we move forward .
and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we are actually ste@@ pping forth and basically le@@ ver@@ aging future education , future children in our h@@ ou@@ se@@ holds .
v@@ as@@ e@@ ct@@ om@@ ies are up 4@@ 8 percent , according to the cor@@ n@@ el@@ l institute .
we also see the trend toward t@@ ou@@ r@@ ism that &apos;s a little bit more low key . right ?
one is the rise toward communities and n@@ ei@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ o@@ ds , and increased em@@ ph@@ as@@ is on your neighbors as your support system .
we also see a big di@@ y movement .
the ar@@ ti@@ san@@ al movement is huge .
then you look at the phenomenon of ko@@ g@@ i .
and then my question became , am i the only one who does this ?
you could ab@@ use it .
that &apos;s what i do in life -- telling stories , writing no@@ v@@ el@@ s -- and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of st@@ or@@ y@@ telling and also some super@@ natural creatures called the d@@ j@@ in@@ n@@ i .
our imagination might s@@ h@@ r@@ ink ; our hearts might d@@ win@@ d@@ le , and our hu@@ man@@ ness might wi@@ ther if we stay for too long inside our cultural co@@ co@@ ons .
it was here that i had my first encounter with what i call the &quot; re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative for@@ ei@@ g@@ ner . &quot;
i &apos;m not an im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e or ex@@ i@@ le -- they ask me why i do this -- but the com@@ mu@@ te between languages gives me the chance to re@@ create myself .
he wanted to see the man@@ i@@ fe@@ st@@ ation of my identity .
my mi@@ cr@@ o story became a ma@@ cr@@ o issue when i was pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted .
literature has to take us beyond .
i might write about a muslim woman in one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , i might write about a hand@@ some , gay professor in nor@@ way .
it &apos;s how you re@@ mix . you take existing songs , you ch@@ o@@ p them up , you transform the pieces , you combine them back together again , and you &apos;ve got a new song , but that new song is clearly com@@ pris@@ ed of old songs .
instead , these laws and laws around the world use the rather a@@ w@@ k@@ ward an@@ al@@ o@@ gy of property .
it &apos;s a 2@@ 8@@ -@@ page software patent , but i will su@@ m@@ mar@@ ize what it co@@ vers . spo@@ il@@ er al@@ er@@ t : un@@ lo@@ cking your phone by sli@@ ding an ic@@ on with your finger .
our creativity comes from without , not from within .
and you say then , &quot; ok , then how do you know your home address ? &quot;
but actually , it &apos;s not my f@@ au@@ lt ; it &apos;s from the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the limb there some fa@@ in@@ t , sort of , wi@@ sp@@ s of almost smoke rising up from the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now that led to an understanding of at@@ om@@ ic structure because the way that &apos;s explained is atoms are a single nu@@ c@@ le@@ us with el@@ e@@ c@@ tr@@ ons going around them .
this is the picture of a galaxy , a common &quot; our garden &quot; galaxy with , what , 100 billion stars like our sun in it .
it can also , i think , finally re@@ ve@@ al the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet .
that &apos;s here . that &apos;s home . that &apos;s us .
and with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen , we are like han@@ se@@ l and gre@@ te@@ l leaving bre@@ ad@@ cru@@ m@@ bs of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital wo@@ o@@ ds .
our daughter then joined us at the bre@@ a@@ k@@ fast table , and i asked her , &quot; is there an em@@ ph@@ as@@ is on music li@@ ter@@ ac@@ y in your school ? &quot;
we can &apos;t sit i@@ dly by here either .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th birthday i decided , because i ar@@ gu@@ ed so much and i talk so much , that i was going to stop speaking for just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest .
you don &apos;t … ?
i explained , with a friend who could inter@@ pre@@ t my sign language , that i was john f@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ is , i was walking around the world , i didn &apos;t talk and this was the last time this person &apos;s going to be here inter@@ pre@@ ting for me .
well , i put on my back@@ pack again .
i started talking because i had studied environment .
but the thing that was different was that every birthday , i asked myself about silence , but i never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet .
i was born and raised in north korea .
sometimes , i found small jobs in exchange for food .
i was always worried about being caught and sent back .
i felt so su@@ ff@@ oc@@ ated that i had so much food in america , yet my father died of star@@ v@@ ation .
but i con@@ fi@@ d@@ ently believe that your act of love and car@@ ing can also save another jo@@ se@@ ph &apos;s life and change thousands of other jo@@ se@@ ph@@ s who are still having hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than i expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to water@@ proof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fire@@ proof .
but then i was very dis@@ ap@@ pointed at my pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged people , rich people , government , de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ ers .
and then , year af@@ ter@@ ward , 19@@ 9@@ 5 , in ko@@ be , japan , we had a big earthquake .
then i wonder , what is a permanent and what is a te@@ m@@ por@@ ary building ?
but it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
and that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we &apos;re born , while we &apos;re still in the w@@ om@@ b .
so f@@ et@@ uses are even learning about the particular language that &apos;s spoken in the world that they &apos;ll be born into .
they make up a mix of in@@ flu@@ en@@ ces as individual and i@@ di@@ o@@ sy@@ n@@ cra@@ tic as the woman herself .
why would under@@ nu@@ tri@@ tion in the w@@ om@@ b result in disease later ?
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about p@@ t@@ s@@ d .
m@@ t : this faith in the fi@@ c@@ tional is essential for any kind of the@@ at@@ ri@@ cal experience .
the audience is led to make as@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tions or el@@ ab@@ or@@ ations that are perfectly re@@ as@@ on@@ able , but do not , in fact , match what is being done in front of them .
and if the story is a good one , it might even make us smile .
you may remember this as the a@@ ol@@ -@@ time war@@ ner mer@@ ger , okay , her@@ al@@ ded at the time as the largest single deal of all time .
if you &apos;re a sen@@ i@@ or person at un@@ es@@ co and someone says , &quot; so what are you doing to er@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ate world poverty ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we do an advertising campaign ?
that is actually strategy , and i &apos;m not den@@ ying that strategy has a role .
it all became music to me .
now , what this means is that if i run this piece of software , the camera sees the in@@ f@@ r@@ ar@@ ed dot , and i can re@@ gi@@ ster the location of the camera pi@@ x@@ els to the pro@@ je@@ ctor pi@@ x@@ els . and now this is like a wh@@ it@@ e@@ board surface .
i remember learning that people who were poor needed something material -- food , clo@@ thing , sh@@ el@@ ter -- that they didn &apos;t have .
and i even felt a sense of shame because of that .
now , when i heard him speak , it was exciting for a number of reasons .
i never once was asked for a don@@ ation , which had kind of been my mode , right .
it &apos;s about re@@ telling the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that v@@ ali@@ d@@ at@@ es their dignity , v@@ ali@@ d@@ at@@ es a par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ ship relationship , not a relationship that &apos;s based on the traditional sort of don@@ or ben@@ e@@ fi@@ ci@@ ary w@@ ei@@ r@@ dness that can happen .
that &apos;s a much more meaningful combination , a more powerful combination .
right now , pro@@ fo@@ under &apos;s right at the very beginning , and it &apos;s very pal@@ p@@ able ; it &apos;s very clear to me , that it &apos;s just a v@@ es@@ se@@ l , it &apos;s just a tool .
what is the future of the human race ?
i now turn to the second big question : are we alone , or is there other life in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
look at that .
so here are pictures of myself .
in fact , it &apos;s d@@ ou@@ bling every 18 months , and , of course , every car@@ d-@@ carrying member of the di@@ ger@@ at@@ i knows that that &apos;s mo@@ ore &apos;s law .
but what about you ? what &apos;s it going to do to you ?
sa@@ il@@ ing the sk@@ ies in their s@@ au@@ c@@ ers and oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally ab@@ du@@ cting people for experiments their parents wouldn &apos;t ap@@ pro@@ ve of .
okay , so we &apos;re interested in these sorts of things .
previous generations couldn &apos;t do this experiment at all .
and i learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools , 2@@ .@@ 6 million years ago .
a very important environmental lesson could be learned from this .
and you see me worried and trying to protect my child , because you don &apos;t leave anyone with this kind of child , even a minister .
and second , she tells us that she walked up@@ right , but had some a@@ da@@ p@@ tation for tree climbing .
up to now , the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fo@@ s@@ si@@ ls , the baby fo@@ s@@ si@@ ls , were missing .
pal@@ e@@ o@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ po@@ lo@@ g@@ ist z@@ er@@ es@@ en@@ a@@ y al@@ em@@ se@@ ged looks for the roots of humanity in ethiopia &apos;s b@@ ad@@ lands . here he talks about finding the oldest skeleton of a hu@@ man@@ o@@ id child -- and how africa holds the c@@ lu@@ es to our humanity .
and of course , if you want people to play by the rules , you still need an effective system of mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing and en@@ for@@ c@@ em@@ ent , for as we &apos;ve discovered , you can trust , but you also need to ver@@ i@@ fy .
it &apos;s considered high se@@ as , because the continent has been put off limits to ter@@ ri@@ t@@ ori@@ al c@@ la@@ im@@ s .
we need to work lo@@ cally , but we also need to work o@@ ce@@ an@@ -@@ bas@@ in-@@ wide .
we need to get the new paradigm of pre@@ c@@ au@@ tion and respect .
c@@ ar@@ o@@ l co@@ le@@ tt@@ a says , &quot; i would pay someone to do what i do . &quot;
i &apos;d say it was a pretty good idea .
now to be clear , i &apos;m a journalist and not a te@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ g@@ ist , so what i &apos;d like to do b@@ ri@@ e@@ fly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
now in clo@@ sing , i think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality -- and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
it looks like cru@@ de oil .
so the symptoms of the complex are , no matter how complicated the problem , you have an absolutely over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing belief that you are in@@ f@@ al@@ li@@ bly right in your solution .
c@@ es@@ ar and i tried to write a piece for the new york times magazine explaining how this works .
we clearly can .
you make lots of money .
it &apos;s far higher than the failure rate of , say , americans .
we &apos;re going to test them out . they &apos;ll probably all fail .
shut it down at once . &quot;
t@@ ani@@ y@@ am@@ a tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true .
what i &apos;m saying is our approach is simply un@@ sustainable .
china plans to be there in just 20 years .
we &apos;re not even s@@ lo@@ wing down .
the future is in@@ her@@ ently un@@ certain .
yes , things will get ugly , and it will happen soon -- certainly in our lifetime -- but we are more than capable of getting through everything that &apos;s coming .
and this is where you come in .
and what you have to think about is , when you &apos;re dancing in the fl@@ am@@ es , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we were going to be able to lay these de@@ b@@ ts off on our kids , but , guess what ?
everything else is m@@ and@@ ated .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in .
this should not surprise you , right ?
and all we &apos;ve got is a ro@@ om@@ b@@ a .
they &apos;ll be able to focus their hearing , they &apos;ll be able to increase the sen@@ si@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty , de@@ cre@@ ase the sen@@ si@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty , do a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
and i think this isn &apos;t 1,000 years out .
we should out@@ law this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children . &quot;
and that &apos;s that middle set of bars .
we can &apos;t risk ali@@ en@@ ating them by testing se@@ at@@ bel@@ ts relative to car seats . &quot;
it only got a 500 , it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a big j@@ ar full of pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o p@@ il@@ l@@ s that he would give them , and he &apos;d say , &quot; come back in a week , if you still feel l@@ ou@@ s@@ y . &quot;
the internet , the web as we know it , the kind of web -- the things we &apos;re all talking about -- is already less than 5,000 days old .
and of course , the internet is longer than just 5,000 days ; the web is only 5,000 days .
so if we say this machine right now that we &apos;ve made is about one h@@ b , one human brain , if we look at the rate that this is increasing , 30 years from now , there &apos;ll be six billion h@@ bs .
right now , it &apos;s not . if you do sp@@ re@@ ad@@ she@@ ets and things at work , a word document , they aren &apos;t on the web , but they are going to be . they &apos;re going to be part of this machine .
and i &apos;m saying , &quot; humans are now going to be the ex@@ ten@@ ded senses of the machine , &quot; in a certain sense .
it &apos;s being res@@ ol@@ ved at the level of it@@ em@@ s , or ideas , or words , if you want .
so , the last thing i want to talk about is this idea that we &apos;re going to be co@@ dependent .
and th@@ ir@@ dly , it &apos;s going to become more u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous in terms of fil@@ ling your entire environment , and we will be in the middle of it .
and within a week i had come to believe that the second coming of ch@@ r@@ ist had occurred , that it was sun my@@ un@@ g moon , and that i had been speci@@ ally chosen and prepared by god to be his dis@@ ci@@ p@@ le .
these are the dead in j@@ on@@ e@@ sto@@ wn .
and it makes anything possible , makes anything ra@@ ti@@ on@@ ali@@ z@@ able .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple kind of no@@ tions of how we organize things .
this is a project that we just finished in pen@@ an@@ g for a very , very large city project that came directly out of this process , which is the result of the multi@@ p@@ li@@ city of forces that produce it .
and that turned right away into another project .
it &apos;s a wrong at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , actually , because the hy@@ bri@@ d is probably more interesting .
what i &apos;m interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- it &apos;s a c@@ ou@@ r@@ th@@ ou@@ se .
so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please .
those have to pay tu@@ i@@ tion fe@@ es know .
now having a large brain , as you know , is a big advantage , because you can actually influence your environment .
so my story is a t@@ al@@ e of two brains , because it might surprise you , our gut has a f@@ ul@@ l@@ -@@ fle@@ d@@ ged brain .
this control of muscle is very , very important , because , you know , there can be re@@ fle@@ x@@ es .
we have learned to talk to the big brain -- taste and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , clearly at some point , we were all of an animal nature , and at some point , we weren &apos;t . &quot;
these are men and women who , even today , can name 250 stars in the night sky .
and of course , this is what the ti@@ be@@ t@@ an mon@@ ks told us .
the in@@ ti@@ w@@ at@@ an@@ a , the h@@ it@@ ching post to the sun , is actually an o@@ be@@ li@@ s@@ k that constantly re@@ fle@@ cts the light that falls on the s@@ ac@@ red ap@@ u of ma@@ ch@@ u p@@ ic@@ ch@@ u , which is su@@ gar@@ lo@@ a@@ f mountain , called hu@@ a@@ y@@ na p@@ ic@@ ch@@ u .
when they pra@@ y for the dead , they make these ge@@ st@@ ur@@ es with their hands , sp@@ in@@ n@@ ing their thoughts into the hea@@ v@@ ens .
and this is actually the place where the great mother sent the sp@@ in@@ d@@ le into the world that el@@ e@@ v@@ ated the mountains and created the hom@@ el@@ and that they call the heart of the world .
they &apos;re unique f@@ ac@@ ets of the human imagination .
this is a material you all know is st@@ y@@ ro@@ fo@@ am , but i like to think of it as toxic white stuff .
i fit into it , you fit into it , and a hundred years t@@ op@@ s , my body can return to the earth with no pre@@ processing .
it &apos;s a waste product .
you want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice h@@ ul@@ l or peak c@@ ot@@ t@@ on@@ seed h@@ ul@@ ls , because you have multiple choices .
first you tra@@ p atoms in a special bottle .
i started a con@@ test four years ago called dance your ph@@ .@@ d@@ .
so now my country is 15 trillion dollars in de@@ b@@ t .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s rather more challenging than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me .
and she was thinking about the work i did developing mathematical models for understanding evolution and modern gen@@ e@@ tics .
the other half of the audience doesn &apos;t like head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ tail -- they think , for deep cultural reasons , that &apos;s boring -- and they &apos;re much more interested in a different pattern -- head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ head .
there are two ways of thinking about this .
when you to@@ ss a co@@ in , you get a sequence of heads and ta@@ ils .
back to some of the more m@@ und@@ an@@ e issues of thinking about un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty .
it &apos;ll only get it wrong one percent of the time .
so he said , &quot; i &apos;ll assume that if you have one co@@ t death in a family , the chance of a second child dying from co@@ t death aren &apos;t changed . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 7@@ 3 million , but non@@ e@@ th@@ eless rather unlikely .
all of quality control , which has had a major impact on industrial processing , is under@@ p@@ in@@ n@@ ed by statistics .
the smoke al@@ arm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives , worldwide .
an intelligent re@@ ce@@ p@@ t@@ ac@@ le pre@@ v@@ ents in@@ ju@@ ri@@ es because the power is always off , until an intelligent pl@@ u@@ g is de@@ te@@ cted . simple .
but at the same time , on the other hand , china is a sick country , the ter@@ min@@ ology co@@ ined by facebook i@@ p@@ o papers -- fi@@ le .
you have facebook , we have ren@@ r@@ en .
but itself -- the ch@@ in@@ an@@ et -- but itself can create very powerful energy , which has never happened in the chinese history .
so because of this , the chinese really re@@ g@@ ard this micro@@ b@@ lo@@ g@@ ging as a media , not only a head@@ line to media .
it &apos;s like a big ted , right ?
so these three years , in the past three years , social movements about micro@@ b@@ lo@@ g@@ ging really changed local government , became more and more transparent , because they can &apos;t access the data .
more and more chinese in@@ tend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their bi@@ r@@ th@@ right , not some im@@ por@@ ted american privilege .
so many of you know that that &apos;s be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ v@@ en &apos;s se@@ v@@ ent@@ h sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y .
i &apos;m not saying that they can &apos;t live a beautiful , wonderful life .
girl : well sometimes my sister can be kind of an@@ no@@ ying .
the ac@@ ou@@ st@@ ics of music are much harder than those of language .
that &apos;s a vi@@ o@@ li@@ n .
and it turns out that his te@@ m@@ po@@ ra@@ l bones were har@@ v@@ e@@ st@@ ed when he died to try to look at the cause of his de@@ af@@ ness , which is why he has m@@ ol@@ ding clay and his skull is bul@@ ging out on the side there .
c@@ l : jo@@ se@@ ph is ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al . he &apos;s brilliant .
when i look around this te@@ d@@ x@@ am@@ st@@ er@@ da@@ m ven@@ u@@ e , i see a very special audience .
in many countries it is a different story .
at this de@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ ve moment in du@@ t@@ ch history my father was pos@@ i@@ ti@@ on@@ ed near the city of ni@@ j@@ me@@ g@@ en .
and oc@@ cur@@ r@@ en@@ ces of civil war and re@@ pres@@ sion have de@@ c@@ lin@@ ed since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace .
peter van u@@ h@@ m : why i chose a gun
and this program takes a shape , sp@@ its out 250 dna se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces .
this is a fri@@ ction climb , up in tu@@ ol@@ um@@ ne me@@ a@@ do@@ ws , in the yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te high country .
you &apos;ve got to keep going .
i &apos;ve been quite interested in both .
and i &apos;m going to show you a small sample of this , but there &apos;s really a the@@ or@@ e@@ tic@@ al reason why technology de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ s in an ex@@ po@@ n@@ en@@ ti@@ al fashion .
but anyway , the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and then working through interaction , evolution used , essentially , the te@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ g@@ y-@@ creating species to bring on the next stage , which were the first steps in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we might as well use the third dimension .
we &apos;ve had 2@@ 8 percent per year com@@ po@@ und@@ ed growth in dollars in information technology over the last 50 years .
another major revolution : the com@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ ations revolution .
if we come back to our ex@@ po@@ n@@ en@@ ti@@ al growth of computing , 1,000 dollars of computing is now somewhere between an in@@ se@@ ct and a mouse brain .
but if we go to 20@@ 2@@ 9 , we really have the full ma@@ tu@@ ri@@ ty of these trends , and you have to appreciate how many turns of the s@@ cre@@ w in terms of generations of technology , which are getting faster and faster , we &apos;ll have at that point .
they both em@@ power our promise and our per@@ il .
it &apos;s more difficult .
you &apos;ve been taken out of the gene pool .
because there &apos;s nothing in this . well , al@@ le@@ ge@@ dly there &apos;s nothing .
so d@@ op@@ am@@ ine appears to be the drug associated with pat@@ ter@@ ni@@ city .
and we then call that s@@ ch@@ i@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ ia .
and he was kind enough to post this and give us the re@@ ve@@ al .
now i said back in our little thought experiment , you &apos;re a hom@@ in@@ id walking on the pla@@ ins of africa .
and 9 / 11 has a con@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ cy theory . it is a con@@ sp@@ i@@ ra@@ cy .
and we have our own li@@ p bal@@ m , and we have a leading brand .
i didn &apos;t do it as well , but we managed to get y@@ ou@@ s@@ so@@ u n &apos;@@ d@@ our , sting , tra@@ cy ch@@ ap@@ man , and br@@ u@@ ce sp@@ r@@ ing@@ ste@@ en to go &apos; round the world for am@@ ne@@ sty , and it was an amazing experience .
they kept telling us , &quot; tell the truth ! &quot; as they beat us .
mu@@ si@@ ci@@ an and ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ist peter g@@ ab@@ ri@@ el shares his very personal motivation for standing up for human rights with the w@@ at@@ ch@@ dog group wi@@ t@@ ness -- and tells stories of ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ alists in action .
so our next question then was , how are they doing this ?
he knows exactly what the problem is , and he knows exactly how to deal with it , and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to re@@ ori@@ ent@@ ate themselves .
and if you look over here , with bo@@ ots they climb onto the ball far less often when they had no bo@@ ots on .
so here &apos;s our c@@ un@@ ning ex@@ per@@ im@@ enter .
so let &apos;s play a 5@@ 5@@ 0@@ -@@ her@@ z frequency and watch what happens .
this is ste@@ p@@ h@@ en ha@@ w@@ king &apos;s universe .
thank you .
m@@ al@@ l@@ ory &apos;s argument that leaving the house , em@@ bar@@ king on these grand ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ur@@ es is jo@@ y@@ ful and fun , however , doesn &apos;t t@@ ally that ne@@ at@@ ly with my own experience .
or , &quot; that &apos;s nice . you know , my grandmother &apos;s going on a cru@@ ise to ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a next year . you know .
and so therefore , the entire purpose of a v@@ c pit@@ ch is to convince them that you are the ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eu@@ r in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return .
and now along with that , along with the experience of starting an en@@ ter@@ pr@@ ise , or running something -- and it doesn &apos;t have to be a business .
there &apos;s never been an an@@ g@@ el@@ - or a v@@ ent@@ u@@ re-@@ funded company where bad things didn &apos;t happen .
and then from there , you &apos;ve got to take them on a very solid , ste@@ ad@@ y , up@@ ward path , right from beginning to end .
o@@ d@@ ds are i probably know somebody who has made a wi@@ d@@ get .
no , they &apos;re not .
and then you want to give me a quick business over@@ view .
even if the competition is the old way of doing something .
so hopefully everything has been positive , positive , positive , more positive .
if you follow my su@@ g@@ ge@@ sti@@ ons , you &apos;re going to have a very sp@@ are , very z@@ en@@ -@@ like presentation , which is great for con@@ ve@@ ying who you are and getting people e@@ mo@@ ti@@ on@@ ally involved .
i didn &apos;t know that ; that &apos;s pretty cool .
sta@@ ti@@ st@@ ically , one of you is a be@@ et@@ le .
if you im@@ it@@ ate something , maybe you can have an effect on it .
and then when you &apos;ve had your fill of that , you can click on one more link .
there we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that doesn &apos;t value innovation .
the way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of be@@ having is broken .
we have a serious me@@ me running through .
but i &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the biggest ne@@ ot@@ en@@ ists ?
it &apos;s pretty b@@ le@@ a@@ k .
our thinking is backwards .
through some basic change , change like im@@ pro@@ ving transparency , change like pro@@ m@@ ot@@ ing self-@@ direction and collaboration , en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ging collaboration , not au@@ to@@ cra@@ cy , the things like having a res@@ ul@@ t@@ s@@ -@@ focus .
because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the ru@@ t that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform bul@@ g@@ ari@@ a for the better .
the industrial design magazine , i believe , is called &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to set o@@ v@@ ens because this was part of o@@ ven@@ -@@ making , o@@ ven@@ -@@ setting , in the time .
after i br@@ us@@ hed them off with a hand motion , they were very -- i finally was now ac@@ ce@@ p@@ ted , and worked there for some six months .
i had a fire nine days ago .
you know -- all the stuff .
my children , da@@ v@@ ey and h@@ en@@ ry .
we sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ bed to a lot of ma@@ ga@@ z@@ in@@ es , did our hom@@ e@@ work , but really everywhere you look around , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and i brought him over .
r@@ g : u@@ h oh .
a@@ v : so t@@ ab@@ o@@ o number three : you can &apos;t talk about your mis@@ car@@ ri@@ age -- but today i &apos;ll talk about mine .
the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in the mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le that is ch@@ il@@ d@@ birth and family .
but you realize you res@@ u@@ b@@ mit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way , which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gra@@ ti@@ fying .
r@@ g + a@@ v : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with gl@@ en@@ n g@@ ou@@ l@@ d .
ultimately , i started with the experience .
all right , there &apos;s this e@@ p@@ is@@ o@@ de of &quot; star tre@@ k . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all these &quot; star tre@@ ks , &quot; and they &apos;re all h@@ ol@@ o@@ de@@ ck e@@ p@@ is@@ o@@ des as well .
imagine hearing great , de@@ par@@ ted pi@@ ani@@ sts play again today , just as they would in person . john q@@ . wal@@ ker de@@ mon@@ st@@ r@@ ates how re@@ cor@@ d@@ ings can be an@@ al@@ y@@ zed for precise ke@@ y@@ st@@ ro@@ kes and pe@@ d@@ al mo@@ tions , then played back on com@@ pu@@ ter@@ -@@ controlled grand pi@@ an@@ os .
now , since that time , we &apos;ve actually been through an extraordinary bo@@ om , the lon@@ g@@ es@@ t bo@@ om ever in the history of this country .
but now , a few months on , however good politicians are at s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wing f@@ ro@@ gs without pulling a face , as someone once put it , they can &apos;t hide their un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty .
now , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy who was then an 8@@ 0@@ -@@ year-old , slightly sh@@ am@@ bo@@ li@@ c man who lived on to@@ ma@@ to s@@ ou@@ p and thought ir@@ on@@ ing was very over@@ r@@ ated .
but interestingly too , it im@@ p@@ li@@ es a future where society le@@ ar@@ ns a few tricks from capitalism about how you em@@ bed the dna of re@@ st@@ less con@@ tin@@ u@@ al innovation into society , trying things out and then growing and sc@@ al@@ ing the ones that work .
what i &apos;m here to talk with you about today is an in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing new hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is and some sur@@ pris@@ ingly powerful new fin@@ d@@ ings that i &apos;ve been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the pro@@ pen@@ si@@ ty to save .
and in fact , if i want to speak cor@@ re@@ ct@@ ly , chinese forces me to constantly think about it .
now this is a f@@ an@@ ci@@ ful theory .
would you mind squ@@ e@@ e@@ zing as hard as you can , in your d@@ om@@ in@@ ant hand , this device so i can measure your gri@@ p strength ?
it &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
it &apos;s not necessary to tell you how important it is to be able to communicate across generations .
we english teachers re@@ je@@ ct them all the time .
but i am against using it as a bar@@ ri@@ er .
but they couldn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
while this was all going on , i was in the field of weather mo@@ di@@ fication , although getting a ph@@ .@@ d@@ . in a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tics .
humans and m@@ us@@ k@@ r@@ ats and gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ es and birds and so on , are -- the red line goes up . that &apos;s the humans and li@@ ve@@ stock and p@@ ets por@@ tion .
we focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future , and we produced products for the company .
let &apos;s have the next video .
this was flying around in the party last night , and -- -- you can see how it just can fly around , and you can sp@@ y on anybody you want .
and he was dis@@ con@@ t@@ ent@@ ed with the state of people &apos;s practice of the bu@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ ist religion in india at that time .
and he comes to the town . he &apos;s a broken person .
and he had to close his eyes , it &apos;s so dis@@ gu@@ sting , and the smell and everything .
the animals are in one of their human lives . the humans are human .
we expand . we take the feeling about re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ing a ma@@ ma , and we de@@ f@@ use that to all beings in this medi@@ tation .
and then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy , when they are sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fied .
and , of course , they are cru@@ el and ru@@ th@@ less toward others .
although , the change in your mind already does something for other beings : they can sense this new quality in yourself , and it helps them already , and gives them an example .
so the coffee cup , or the cup with a handle , is one of the tools used by society to maintain public health .
and , interestingly , complexity is very highly evolved .
we &apos;ve heard from bill gates recently .
so it is very , very simple once you learn how to read it .
all right , let me then finish off with four general stat@@ em@@ ents , an example and two a@@ ph@@ or@@ is@@ ms .
and i don &apos;t want to spend your time in going through the details , but in the lower ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand corner , you see an example of the kind of thing that we have .
have you started to do that ?
and out of that , you get the need for the kind of things that j@@ im@@ my was talking about , which is our new kinds of organization , or a better way to put it : how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
more and more , the inv@@ ent@@ ors of things it will be worked out in use , in collaboration with users .
take a@@ st@@ r@@ on@@ om@@ y as an example , which yo@@ ch@@ a@@ i has already mentioned .
there &apos;ll be huge professional arguments as well .
so it &apos;s not going to be a con@@ test between two cam@@ ps , but , in between them , you &apos;ll find all sorts of interesting places that people will oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y .
that costs about 100 dollars .
and people started la@@ ying bread in tri@@ bu@@ te , and eventually a team was able to do it between new z@@ e@@ al@@ and and sp@@ a@@ in .
so the first thing i thought of is we have to thank him .
but the truth is life is being lived there .
and people called in and left messages like this .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m d@@ res@@ sed as bat@@ man to hide my identity . &quot;
and the person who didn &apos;t , it turned out , had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job .
and over the past 35 years , i &apos;ve studied behavior on the basis of everything from genes through neuro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters , d@@ op@@ am@@ ine , things like that , all the way through circuit analysis .
some of you have this . and it &apos;s se@@ x@@ -@@ linked .
this was one of these cases , because she has no violence in her background , but my father did .
and now they are close as can be .
and actually , this morning , i got an email saying that we &apos;ve just finished , today , building the last piece of at@@ l@@ as .
and these guys , here , they &apos;re the weak nuclear force , probably the least familiar .
so , you want to know why the sky is blue , why at@@ om@@ ic nu@@ c@@ le@@ i stick together -- in principle , you &apos;ve got a big enough computer -- why dna is the shape it is .
the an@@ al@@ o@@ gy is that these people in a room are the higgs particles .
but actually , with this theory , we find that the forces of nature do seem to uni@@ fy together , back at the big bang -- absolutely beautiful pro@@ p@@ he@@ cy . the model wasn &apos;t built to do that , but it seems to do it .
and built this civilization , this wonderful picture , that turned the darkness into light , and you can see the civilization from space .
another a@@ ha ! moment came from a 2010 wa@@ y@@ ne state university research project that looked into pre-@@ 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s bas@@ e@@ ball cards of major le@@ a@@ gue players .
in a related german study , researchers used f@@ m@@ r@@ i i@@ ma@@ ging to measure brain activity before and after in@@ je@@ cting bot@@ o@@ x to supp@@ res@@ s s@@ m@@ il@@ ing muscles .
&quot; because the colors you have or@@ der@@ ed do not meet european standards , &quot; he re@@ p@@ li@@ ed .
&quot; sa@@ f@@ er ? why ? they have po@@ sted more po@@ li@@ ce@@ men here ? &quot;
we built the bright new re@@ ce@@ p@@ tion hall that made people , ti@@ ran@@ a citizens , think they had traveled ab@@ road when they entered to make their re@@ qu@@ e@@ st@@ s .
president ro@@ o@@ se@@ v@@ el@@ t , he said , &quot; believe you can , and you are hal@@ f@@ way there . &quot;
on street sides all over por@@ t@@ -@@ au@@ -@@ pr@@ in@@ ce , entrepreneurs sp@@ r@@ un@@ g up o@@ ff@@ ering mobile phone char@@ ging stations .
one il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tion of the trans@@ for@@ ma@@ tional power of technology is in ki@@ ber@@ a .
by 20@@ 15 , there will be three billion s@@ mar@@ t@@ phones in the world .
the stores ne@@ ar@@ by were out of f@@ l@@ as@@ h@@ lights and bat@@ ter@@ i@@ es and bread .
now , the flow of time is embedded in everything , in the er@@ o@@ sion of a grain of sand , in the bu@@ d@@ ding of a little bu@@ d into a ro@@ se .
are you reading an interview by an author ?
and even here , when i look at the great bear , i get back that feeling of being a child , hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder , and i can get back that feeling of being a child again .
we &apos;ve seen again and again just how creative technology can be , and in our lives and in our actions , we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that re@@ store the flow of time instead of fra@@ g@@ m@@ ent@@ ing it .
my mother was english .
at every single re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , she has to face off soldiers who want to take my el@@ der brother mark , who was nine , and make him a boy sol@@ di@@ er .
and i was supposed to do this alone .
take anything you want out of the su@@ it@@ case .
that &apos;s how i ended up in so@@ li@@ t@@ ary , because i let my feelings be known .
thank you .
so almost all life on earth is wi@@ ped out about five times .
well s@@ van@@ te pa@@ ab@@ o has the answer .
why would that matter ?
so in theory , you could grow any organ from any one of your cells .
here &apos;s the increase in less than a decade .
here &apos;s the bottom line .
if you sp@@ in these ro@@ t@@ ors at the same speed , the robot ho@@ vers .
and it shows you how ro@@ b@@ us@@ t the control is .
and it does that a@@ vo@@ i@@ ding ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les .
they sense their neighbors .
so this just shows that we can double , tri@@ p@@ le , qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ p@@ le the robot strength by just getting them to team with neighbors , as you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where to go on its own .
i understand that . but , there are many things to know , and i want you to open your minds here , keep them open , and change your perspective about h@@ on@@ e@@ y@@ bees .
now this has been a huge problem for many years , basically since the late 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , when the v@@ ar@@ ro@@ a mi@@ te came and brought many different viruses , bacteria and f@@ un@@ g@@ al diseases with it .
they don &apos;t experience this .
that &apos;s what the che@@ f@@ s go to to use for their cooking , and the h@@ on@@ ey -- they do live events -- they &apos;ll use that h@@ on@@ ey at their bars .
the bee dies . h@@ on@@ e@@ y@@ bees die when they sting , so they don &apos;t want to do it either .
okay , now the question is really , why is this so ?
of course we also , particularly in the last decade , managed to en@@ v@@ el@@ op the world in a dense chain of super@@ markets , in a chain of global trade .
and never before have so many people been ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of that fact .
in fact not many of you know that our bread , of course , was not a european invention .
and meat consumption in s@@ ou@@ the@@ as@@ t asia and china in particular is what drives the prices of c@@ er@@ e@@ als .
agriculture science for most people -- and there are not many farmers among you here -- has this name of being bad , of being about pollution , about l@@ ar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale , about the destruction of the environment .
everything is linked together .
and so as i &apos;m fin@@ is@@ h@@ ing my bread here -- and i &apos;ve been ba@@ king it , and i &apos;ll try not to burn my hands .
and f@@ ur@@ ther@@ more , if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas , it has to be re@@ pa@@ ir@@ able using the local tools , materials and knowledge in those con@@ te@@ x@@ ts .
that &apos;s where you can take a guy like me , an academic , but an@@ al@@ y@@ ze and test and create a new technology and qu@@ anti@@ ta@@ tively determine how much better the performance is .
because this is what you will take away from here , a re@@ connection with nature , i hope .
this was just a few days ago in a@@ gu@@ m@@ be .
and what do we do ? how do we respond to this ?
this was actually just taken last year .
but po@@ ol@@ an de@@ v@@ i was one &#91; of them &#93; . which actually she@@ k@@ ha@@ r ka@@ pu@@ r made an incredible movie , &quot; the b@@ and@@ it queen , &quot; which i ur@@ ge you to see .
but i think the final note really is that we can do it .
this guy speci@@ ali@@ zes in p@@ it vi@@ pers .
this is a re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative patient who at the time was 7@@ 3 -- totally needed to have a b@@ y@@ p@@ as@@ s , decided to do this instead .
i like this slide , because it &apos;s a chance to talk about what really mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ates people to change , and what doesn &apos;t .
when you eat a big f@@ at@@ ty meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a half-@@ truth . actually , americans are eating more fat than ever , and even more car@@ bs . and so the percentage is lower , the actual amount is higher , and so the goal is to reduce both .
now , one of the studies funded by the at@@ k@@ in@@ s center found that 70 percent of the people were con@@ sti@@ p@@ ated , 65 percent had bad breath , 5@@ 4 percent had hea@@ da@@ ches – this is not a healthy way to eat .
now , on the other hand , anything that pro@@ m@@ ot@@ es in@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy is he@@ al@@ ing .
hopefully it won &apos;t stu@@ t@@ ter .
this is based on an f@@ . sc@@ ot@@ t f@@ it@@ z@@ ger@@ al@@ d short story .
there were two stu@@ di@@ os involved : war@@ ner brothers and par@@ amount .
and we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence .
so we ab@@ or@@ ted using motion capture .
it seemed to be infinite .
and here &apos;s the res@@ ul@@ ting data that comes from that , the model that comes from that .
so this was how the finished shot appeared in the film .
this is a very , very , very early test in our process .
and we found this right in this very state , in kar@@ n@@ at@@ a@@ k@@ a .
he has a telephone bo@@ ot@@ h .
and the q@@ al@@ and@@ ar people will rise above all this cru@@ el bar@@ bar@@ ic past that they &apos;ve lived all their lives .
there were four of us -- two be@@ d@@ ou@@ in dri@@ vers -- and you can just imagine , this ex@@ pan@@ se is an ocean of sand , 10@@ 5 degrees , one water bottle .
i think the cam@@ el is the best designed animal in the world . &quot;
and they use them in the same way we use our b@@ in@@ o@@ cul@@ ar vision .
we w@@ ei@@ g@@ h our animals .
so i &apos;m going to show you another film .
i usually won &apos;t swe@@ at until my body re@@ ach@@ es 10@@ 5 degrees f -- enough to f@@ r@@ y an e@@ g@@ g .
ri@@ ck@@ y , thank you very much for having me .
start a meeting with a poem . that would be an idea you might take with you .
but how would you like it if you never knew from one day to the next stri@@ ding around like a vi@@ vi@@ d god , your sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders in the clouds , or sitting down there am@@ i@@ d@@ st the w@@ al@@ l@@ paper star@@ ing straight ahead with your little plastic face ?
who could sleep that night ?
but did you know that at your age ju@@ dy gar@@ land was pulling down 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 dollars a picture , jo@@ an of ar@@ c was leading the french army to vi@@ ct@@ ory and bla@@ ise p@@ as@@ cal had c@@ le@@ an@@ ed up his room -- no wait , i mean he had invented the cal@@ cul@@ ator ?
they ended up in a tree , and one of them holds out a hand to the other .
and human morality is more than this , but if you would remove these two p@@ il@@ l@@ ars , there would be not much re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing i think .
another problem with el@@ e@@ ph@@ ants is that you cannot make an app@@ ar@@ at@@ us that is too heavy for a single elephant .
one is the understanding part of it . this is just a regular definition : the ability to understand and share the feelings of another .
now we also study more complex ex@@ pres@@ sions . this is con@@ sol@@ ation .
that this is not a good test for her .
and there &apos;s a very simple task that they need to do .
and so one p@@ hi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ her even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fa@@ ir@@ ness because fa@@ ir@@ ness was invented during the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a l@@ one nu@@ t , it &apos;s not two nu@@ ts -- three is a crowd , and a crowd is news .
i &apos;ve spent the last decade sub@@ je@@ cting myself to pain and hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation , hopefully for a good cause , which is self-@@ im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ent .
and i have to say , thank god .
so i finished , and it was a success in a sense .
and this , over the years , can cause real damage , car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar damage .
a@@ .@@ j@@ . j@@ ac@@ ob@@ s : how healthy living nearly killed me
and i think a lot of scientists have this at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de .
really cool stuff .
now these studies are s@@ ci@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ cally val@@ id , and they &apos;ve been re@@ p@@ li@@ cated , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not being told .
a pri@@ est ?
there &apos;s a last group of people who believe that the in@@ du@@ s people were the ancestors of people living in south india today .
okay . right to left , how many ? okay .
and this could be really useful as we try to de@@ ci@@ ph@@ er the script by gener@@ ating more data that we can an@@ al@@ y@@ ze .
this sign is the most fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ l@@ y-@@ oc@@ cur@@ r@@ ing sign in the in@@ du@@ s script , and it &apos;s only in this text that it oc@@ cur@@ s as a d@@ ou@@ bling pair .
and it turns out that in india there &apos;s a long tradition of names being based on h@@ or@@ o@@ sc@@ op@@ es and star con@@ st@@ ell@@ ations present at the time of birth .
space , we all know what it looks like .
the line carried the telephone signals that would later make bell a h@@ ou@@ se@@ hold name .
j@@ an@@ sky had made a historic discovery , that c@@ el@@ e@@ sti@@ al objects could e@@ mit radio waves as well as light waves .
all the young people , actually , from the city .
you know , someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that &apos;s ok because you &apos;re in a theater , but if you were sitting on a park ben@@ ch and someone came up and sat that close to you , you &apos;d fre@@ ak out .
the d@@ al@@ a@@ i lam@@ a always likes to say -- he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion , it &apos;s because you realize that you yourself and your pa@@ ins and ple@@ as@@ ur@@ es are finally too small a theater for your intelligence .
look at that beautiful thing ch@@ i@@ h@@ o showed us . she scared us with the la@@ va man .
a man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance .
but what more could she have done if she &apos;d had the modern means of com@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ ations available to her to create a sense that the in@@ justice that people saw had to be ac@@ ted upon immediately ?
combine the power of a global e@@ th@@ ic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally , with the challenges that we now face , most of which are global in their nature .
in the rwanda children &apos;s museum , there is a photograph of a 10@@ -year-old boy and the children &apos;s museum is com@@ me@@ mor@@ ating the lives that were lost in the r@@ w@@ and@@ an gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de where a million people died .
and so here &apos;s the challenge : i want you to help me create a fully 3d , dynamic , par@@ am@@ e@@ ter@@ i@@ zed contact model .
they can lo@@ com@@ o@@ te on sub@@ st@@ r@@ ates that v@@ ary as you saw -- in the probability of contact , the movement of that surface and the type of fo@@ o@@ th@@ ol@@ ds that are present .
this one dis@@ gu@@ is@@ es itself as floating al@@ ga@@ e .
boy : sp@@ in@@ y .
let &apos;s slow it down and you can see the sp@@ ines in action .
mark cu@@ t@@ ko@@ sky at stanford university , one of my c@@ ol@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ ators , is an extraordinary engineer who developed this technique called shape de@@ position manufacturing , where he can im@@ bed c@@ la@@ ws right into an artificial foot .
they &apos;re -- almost look alien . and the secret , which they stick on with , involves their ha@@ ir@@ y toes .
here you are , pulling off the b@@ and@@ -@@ aid .
these t@@ un@@ ed structures allow the sp@@ ines , fri@@ ction pa@@ ds and ultimately the ad@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ ve ha@@ ir@@ s to grab onto very challenging , difficult surfaces .
so the large bal@@ e@@ en whales will produce long , beautiful songs , which are used in re@@ productive ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ ment for male and fe@@ males , both to find one another and to s@@ el@@ e@@ ct a mate .
so when dolphins are se@@ par@@ ating by less than 20 meters , less than half the time they need to use wh@@ i@@ st@@ les .
when we think of mar@@ in@@ e-@@ protected areas for animals like dolphins , this means that we have to be quite conscious about activities that we thought were ben@@ ig@@ n .
and after the ber@@ li@@ n wall fell , the na@@ v@@ y made these systems available to whale bio@@ -@@ ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ ci@@ ans to see what they could hear .
you only hear the low fre@@ qu@@ en@@ cies .
now if this signal is used for males and fe@@ males to find each other for ma@@ ting and they &apos;re dis@@ per@@ sed , imagine the impact this could have on the recovery of en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed populations .
and they &apos;ve already found that by being more intelligent about better pro@@ p@@ ell@@ er design , you can reduce that noise by 90 percent .
they could slow down by about 50 percent .
we see alien worlds , we see alien solar systems -- 300 now , and still co@@ un@@ ting -- and they &apos;re not like us .
the whole resources are there available for you .
and we &apos;re seeing a ste@@ ad@@ y increase among males .
and there &apos;s some guy watching a hundred , obviously .
now , when you have in@@ i@@ ti@@ a@@ ti@@ ves like the $ 100 laptop , i kind of cr@@ in@@ ge at the idea that we &apos;re going to introduce a whole new generation of people to computing with this standard m@@ ou@@ se@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ win@@ do@@ w@@ s-@@ po@@ in@@ ter interface .
thank you .
i think none of these is the problem .
daily life in our country is , to say the least , under extraordinary , ex@@ ce@@ p@@ tional circumstances .
usually it &apos;s one or two a year .
and they &apos;re out there !
but we are many more .
part of the challenge was to try to understand r@@ hy@@ th@@ m and space using not just my hands -- because a lot of ju@@ g@@ gl@@ ing is hand@@ -@@ ori@@ ent@@ ed -- but using the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of my body and feet , and controlling the b@@ al@@ l@@ s with my feet .
and then you get crazy .
ok , so since you all don &apos;t understand what the five-@@ ball pattern is , i &apos;m going to give you a little c@@ lu@@ e .
now , one more time , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you &apos;ve got somebody up here who is the op@@ er@@ ative principle of doing that for his whole life . ok ?
and then it comes to rest . just a little thing about time .
working with space and the lines in space in a different way .
and then changing levels .
this year -- maybe you could show the slides -- this year we &apos;re carrying this tre@@ o , which we had a lot to do with and helped hand@@ spring design it .
we can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that , and get more information about the clo@@ thing that you &apos;re interested in as you &apos;re trying it on .
( sc@@ ot@@ t ad@@ am@@ s : i realized that at some point i might be the world &apos;s expert on what &apos;s wrong with cu@@ bi@@ c@@ les .
and we &apos;re an@@ no@@ un@@ cing a new product here tonight , which is the first time this has ever been shown in public .
what they do now is : they can grow crops in the ra@@ in@@ y season but they can &apos;t grow them in the o@@ ff@@ -@@ season .
el@@ e@@ c@@ tr@@ ons disappear in a kind of fu@@ z@@ z , and there is only energy . and you can &apos;t see energy .
that &apos;s what he thought he was there for .
po@@ t@@ at@@ o@@ es , po@@ t@@ at@@ o@@ es have 4@@ 8 ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es . do you know that ?
okay . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well what &apos;s the point of these , h@@ e@@ in@@ rich ?
and we co@@ g@@ it@@ ated about this for about four years .
now when google di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zes a book , they put it into a really nice for@@ m@@ at .
let me give you an example .
suddenly , in the mid-@@ 4@@ 0@@ s , there started to be a bu@@ z@@ z .
but guess what , nobody will really care .
but then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from pro@@ pa@@ g@@ and@@ a .
if you stu@@ b your to@@ e , that &apos;s a one a &quot; ar@@ g@@ h . &quot;
if i left this p@@ ink noise on for more than a couple of minutes , you would literally ce@@ ase to hear it .
many people take re@@ fu@@ ge in head@@ phones , but they turn big , public spaces like this , shared so@@ und@@ sc@@ ap@@ es , into millions of tiny , little personal sound bu@@ b@@ bles .
you can do it in a beautiful place as well , like in a lake .
and finally , an ac@@ r@@ on@@ y@@ m .
and i &apos;d be , like , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you for sta@@ ying here . we &apos;re all so gr@@ at@@ e@@ ful . &quot;
and they walk off .
because they weren &apos;t with us on the si@@ de@@ walk , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd , an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them .
well let me tell you , in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year , because the arab spring is still spreading , the eu@@ ro@@ zone has col@@ la@@ p@@ sed ... what else ?
actually , that photo was pa@@ sted in a police station , and what you see on the ground are id cards of all the photos of people being tra@@ cked by the police .
kids just make photos in a class , the teacher re@@ c@@ ei@@ ves them , they pa@@ st@@ e them on the school .
and today &apos;s talk is about brains and , y@@ a@@ y , somewhere i have a brain fan out there .
and this is something we can work on my lifetime . i felt i could make a difference , and so i tried to get out of the computer business , into the brain business .
but sometimes , a science has some other at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes which makes it really , really interesting .
what good is more going to do ?
there &apos;s something we believe that just , it &apos;s obvious , but it &apos;s wrong .
what it is is intelligence is defined by pre@@ di@@ ction .
but we don &apos;t consider the al@@ li@@ g@@ ator very intelligent , not like in a human sort of way .
in humans , we actually developed the front part of the ne@@ o@@ cortex called the an@@ ter@@ i@@ or part of the ne@@ o@@ cortex . and nature did a little trick .
it &apos;s not like you just look over there and say , what am i seeing now ?
not like computer memory . it &apos;s not at all like computer memory .
those are the things that are going to happen first .
we need a little bit of police ; we need a little bit of military , but for defense .
your ro@@ be gives it away . &quot;
she is traveling because she was out of the country at the time of the el@@ e@@ c@@ tions .
this is ri@@ go@@ ber@@ ta men@@ ch@@ u t@@ um .
and then , when she closed the door , grand@@ ma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
they wash like this : by hand .
this group uses three , one each .
it &apos;s real .
she managed to study english and learn that as a foreign language .
well , the computer did , and in fact did so for one out of three subjects .
if you think so , then you are not like the u.s. em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ers who are , in fact , part of our experiment , meaning we did exactly that .
we re@@ pe@@ ated the experiment with the same two groups , this time adding a del@@ a@@ y between the time we told subjects how we would use their data and the time we actually started an@@ s@@ w@@ er@@ ing the questions .
the price to pay , however , is leaving the garden .
and they were moving and gr@@ in@@ ding and moving their arms up and down each other .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and safety and health ; we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
and so they hire personal tra@@ in@@ ers ; they &apos;re po@@ pping ci@@ al@@ is like breath min@@ ts .
i &apos;m not exactly comfortable with emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is min@@ d@@ sight -- the ability to enter into other people &apos;s minds and learn what they have to offer .
they have e@@ pi@@ ste@@ m@@ ol@@ o@@ gi@@ cal mo@@ de@@ st@@ y .
that is what the un@@ conscious mind h@@ un@@ gers for .
we found her in a ra@@ il@@ way track , ra@@ ped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know many .
where does their journey begin ?
and it &apos;s ab@@ normal to live in a sh@@ el@@ ter .
what has been my challenge ?
they need your empathy .
le@@ x@@ i@@ co@@ graphy : the practice of comp@@ il@@ ing di@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ aries .
well , first of all , i bl@@ am@@ e the queen because it &apos;s funny .
online di@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ aries must be different .
the bad words -- see , when people think about a place and they don &apos;t find a place on the map , they think , &quot; this map su@@ cks ! &quot;
they think , &quot; ok , if we think words are the tools that we use to build the ex@@ pres@@ sions of our thoughts , how can you say that s@@ cre@@ w@@ dri@@ vers are better than ham@@ m@@ ers ?
the o@@ ed has 3@@ 3 different nu@@ m@@ ber@@ ed de@@ fin@@ i@@ tions for set .
and there &apos;s this guy , mi@@ ke o@@ ates . mi@@ ke o@@ ates lives in the u.k.
so , this whole time i &apos;ve been saying , &quot; the di@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ary , the di@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ary , the di@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ary , the di@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ary . &quot;
so , i &apos;m just going to grab a chair here .
and to cut a long story short , here &apos;s where i came to .
and so , gra@@ du@@ ally over these three days , you start off kind of trying to figure out , &quot; why am i listening to all this ir@@ relevant stuff ? &quot;
they may well be by a ted speaker , and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual , emotional journey .
man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ ers haven &apos;t built this car@@ ri@@ er phase technique into their cheap gps chi@@ ps because they &apos;re not sure what the general public would do with ge@@ ol@@ o@@ cation so accurate that you could pin@@ point the w@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ l@@ es in the palm of your hand .
&quot; they &apos;re not sure this ris@@ es to the level of har@@ as@@ s@@ ment , and they &apos;re not set up te@@ ch@@ ni@@ cally to find the device . &quot;
instead of j@@ am@@ m@@ ing the gps signals , you fake them .
and &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves por@@ s and ra@@ o , and we live and work in india .
this is a video prototype .
so this work is a car@@ ic@@ at@@ ure of an up@@ si@@ de@@ -@@ down man .
the debate is over the pro@@ position : &quot; what the world needs now is nuclear energy . &quot; true or false ?
and so far there are only three major sources of that -- coal and gas , hydro@@ -@@ electric , which in most places is ma@@ x@@ e@@ d-@@ out -- and nuclear .
we have been taking down the r@@ us@@ si@@ an war@@ heads , turning it into electricity .
co@@ 2@@ e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse g@@ ases and particles that cause warming and conver@@ ted to co2 .
now if you consider the fact that nuclear weapons pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation is associated with nuclear energy pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation , because we know for example , india and pakistan developed nuclear weapons se@@ cre@@ t@@ ly by en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ing ur@@ ani@@ um in nuclear energy f@@ ac@@ i@@ li@@ ties .
for wind , there &apos;s a larger area , but much smaller footprint .
the reality is that there &apos;s , what , 21 nations that have nuclear power ?
and in the united states sen@@ ate , we need bi@@ par@@ ti@@ s@@ an support -- only one or two v@@ ot@@ es are needed -- to move global warming through the sen@@ ate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les alone .
i used to worry about the 10,000 year factor .
thank you for that .
this was -- my motivation was actually during a@@ po@@ l@@ l@@ o .
for the first time ever , we have enough wealth con@@ c@@ ent@@ r@@ ated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration .
t@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ six teams from seven countries entered the competition , spending between one to 25 million dollars each .
or@@ b@@ it@@ al fli@@ gh@@ ts -- we can take you to the space station .
and the benefit to the s@@ po@@ n@@ s@@ ors is the sum of the pu@@ b@@ li@@ city and soci@@ et@@ al benefits over the long term .
would they surprise us ? would they in@@ tri@@ gue us ?
so that means that surfaces can inter@@ se@@ ct themselves , they can become im@@ possibly small .
a challenge to me was how we could express this new al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ mic order in a col@@ um@@ n .
un@@ be@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ n@@ st to me at the time , because we had only seen the outside , the surfaces were con@@ tin@@ u@@ ing to fold themselves , to grow on the inside of the col@@ um@@ n , which was quite a surprising discovery .
inspired by cell di@@ vision , michael h@@ an@@ s@@ me@@ yer w@@ ri@@ tes algorithms that design ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ously fascinating shapes and forms with millions of f@@ ac@@ ets . no person could dra@@ ft them by hand , but they &apos;re bu@@ il@@ d@@ able -- and they could re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ize the way we think of architectural form .
so look at this picture here -- a lot of shapes dancing around for you .
this one is a disorder which is quite rare .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see this chip even bre@@ a@@ th@@ es .
it &apos;s a very young nation led by young people .
and i think a lot of people in this room , i can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself .
so i think women in our society are becoming leaders , because they realize that for their future generations , it &apos;s very important to maintain our cultural i@@ den@@ ti@@ ties .
we have realized that recently more and more people are using the means of youtube and social ne@@ t@@ working to express their stories , share their photos and tell their own stories through their own voices .
at the same time , we are in@@ vi@@ ting them to come and explore our part of the world .
so i was , more or less , c@@ l@@ as@@ sed as &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought &quot; perhaps , if i made these ants some a@@ par@@ t@@ ments , they &apos;ll move in . &quot;
now that is called the hu@@ f h@@ au@@ s .
so i &apos;m thinking &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back the next day .
and it went ...
my work , r@@ ou@@ g@@ h estimate , sometimes five , six to seven weeks ; you can &apos;t always anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te .
and i b@@ ent it &apos; round , and made it into the ch@@ ari@@ o@@ t .
so i broke the ne@@ e@@ d@@ le .
it &apos;s very pa@@ in@@ sta@@ king work , but the best things come in small p@@ ac@@ k@@ ages .
you want your employees to do what you ask them to do , and if they &apos;ve done that , then they can do extra .
there &apos;s this absolute con@@ c@@ ent@@ ration of being , the absolute con@@ c@@ ent@@ ration of consciousness , awareness , an absolute lo@@ c@@ us of compassion and love that de@@ fin@@ es the primary at@@ tri@@ bu@@ tes of di@@ v@@ in@@ ity .
my man@@ gl@@ ed body flew in one direction , my man@@ gl@@ ed bike flew in the other .
i kept i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ ing all the walks i might not take with them , the art projects i might not mess up , the bo@@ y@@ friends i might not s@@ co@@ w@@ l at , the a@@ is@@ les i might not walk down .
because you don &apos;t need the ge@@ t-@@ to-@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ -@@ you session at that point .
so if you approach them from behind , down wind , you can push them over and they go th@@ u@@ d in the mu@@ d . &quot;
t@@ w@@ ent@@ y years ago , doctors would have cut off my leg and h@@ op@@ ed , and there was a 15 percent survival rate .
as i became less and less human -- and at this moment in my life , i was probably 30 pounds less than i am right now .
and no one cap@@ tures this modern man@@ ho@@ o@@ d to me more than david black .
walking up@@ right , we are told , is the th@@ res@@ hold of what made us human .
he &apos;s the president of the international society of limb sal@@ v@@ age , which is the least eu@@ p@@ he@@ mi@@ stic term i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born three and a half months pre@@ ma@@ ture , and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive .
so as soon as i tried to get near the piano , i was fi@@ r@@ m@@ ly sho@@ ved off .
and in the end , you got so quick , that things like &quot; flight of the bu@@ m@@ ble@@ bee &quot; were no problem , were they ?
would you like to hear me play ?
d@@ p : &quot; ti@@ ger ra@@ g . &quot;
i don &apos;t get it .
they &apos;re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that &apos;s clean , a world that isn &apos;t con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ ated , a world that isn &apos;t po@@ l@@ lu@@ ted .
so that we know today , they &apos;re capable of per@@ for@@ man@@ ces that would have been thought absolutely impossible by science when i began .
the long-term a@@ ff@@ e@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ate su@@ p@@ por@@ tive bon@@ ds that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother , with the brothers and si@@ sters , and which can last through a lifetime , which may be up to 60 years .
and it &apos;s not sustainable , and the huge lo@@ g@@ ging cam@@ ps in the forest are now de@@ m@@ and@@ ing meat , so the p@@ y@@ g@@ my h@@ un@@ ter@@ s in the congo bas@@ in who &apos;ve lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now cor@@ ru@@ p@@ ted .
somebody said that yesterday .
we &apos;re in every state now , and the problems in fl@@ ori@@ da are different from the problems in new york .
are you going to come and dra@@ g me off ?
is it out there with the politicians ?
in the laboratory what we want to do is much the same , but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a dra@@ stic reduction in complexity , but still trying to produce something that looks li@@ fe@@ like .
it &apos;s actually quite li@@ f@@ el@@ ess . once it forms , it doesn &apos;t really do anything .
so now that you &apos;re all experts on pro@@ to@@ cells , we &apos;re going to play a game with these pro@@ to@@ cells .
so we &apos;re able to then see the self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bly of these oil dro@@ p@@ let bodies again that we &apos;ve seen pre@@ vi@@ ously , and the black spots inside of there represent this kind of black t@@ ar -- this diverse , very complex , organic black t@@ ar .
in his lab , martin han@@ c@@ z@@ y@@ c makes &quot; pro@@ to@@ cells , &quot; ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent@@ al b@@ lo@@ bs of chemicals that behave like living cells . his work de@@ mon@@ st@@ r@@ ates how life might have first occurred on earth ... and perhaps elsewhere too .
this is a ta@@ d@@ pole wal@@ ker to take your ta@@ d@@ pole walking in the evening .
what &apos;s the -- how did you know that ? they did .
but if we did this in every single -- every fire hy@@ dr@@ ant we could re@@ define the emergency .
carbon black is that gri@@ me that otherwise lo@@ d@@ ges in your pretty p@@ ink l@@ un@@ g@@ s , and it &apos;s associated with .
the birds were able to jump from one to the other .
you can sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ be to up@@ d@@ at@@ es from him . you can talk to him .
but ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in@@ ing this her@@ d takes a major t@@ ol@@ l on our planet .
we then is@@ ol@@ ate the skin cells and multi@@ p@@ ly them in a cell culture medium .
already , we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years , beginning with products like wine , beer and yo@@ g@@ ur@@ t .
the fact is , when we do our market research around the world , we see that there &apos;s nearly a universal as@@ pi@@ ration on the part of people to own an au@@ t@@ om@@ o@@ bi@@ le .
so let me talk about hydrogen first .
that &apos;s a huge po@@ w@@ er@@ -@@ gener@@ ating cap@@ ability , a mobile po@@ w@@ er@@ -@@ gener@@ ating cap@@ ability .
if we can see this possible future , others can too .
you had to survive .
and we made sure that we were still attached to our school di@@ stri@@ ct for funding , for support .
because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live ?
it became a book . it became a show .
and l@@ é@@ il@@ a came up with an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here , on the west coast , you &apos;ve destroyed your forest .
but you can see in this picture , we were starting to con@@ st@@ ru@@ ct an educational center that became quite a large environmental center in brazil .
and so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies , i studied this emerging field of landscape e@@ col@@ o@@ gy .
and if i zoom in to lower manhattan you can see the extent of new york city as it was , right at the end of the american revolution .
the white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter win@@ ds .
or the bo@@ g tur@@ t@@ le , ne@@ e@@ ding we@@ t me@@ a@@ do@@ ws and insects and sun@@ ny places .
maybe a ti@@ m@@ ber r@@ at@@ t@@ les@@ na@@ ke lived there .
there is such power in bringing science and vis@@ u@@ alization together , that we can create images like this , perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass .
and we , at the moment , in our society , have a really dramatically un@@ sustainable level of this .
i don &apos;t need to go into that .
you leave aside what is natural to be natural .
this is a bio@@ -@@ mor@@ p@@ hi@@ c building .
one place we &apos;re all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question , in a very artistic and indi@@ re@@ ct kind of way .
but it &apos;s happening all over the place , and these tools are part of what &apos;s making it possible .
seriously -- give that one a hand , it &apos;s pretty great .
al@@ e@@ x ste@@ ff@@ en : the r@@ ou@@ te to a sustainable future
and you &apos;d think that would be a pretty big problem for a law , but congress seems not to have let that bo@@ ther them too much .
if you make lots and lots of high quality c@@ op@@ ies and you sell them , that &apos;s not okay .
some of the stuff we share is stuff we &apos;ve made out of what we &apos;ve found , and all of it h@@ or@@ ri@@ fi@@ es those in@@ du@@ stri@@ es .
that &apos;s the easy thing .
i went to a very e@@ li@@ ti@@ st , s@@ no@@ b@@ bis@@ h , expensive education in india , and that almost destroyed me .
and i thought i &apos;d start a bar@@ e@@ foot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional is someone who has a combination of comp@@ et@@ ence , confidence and belief .
so when i said that , they said , &quot; well show us what is possible . what are you doing ?
all the power comes from the sun .
democracy , ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ ship , how you should measure your land , what you should do if you &apos;re ar@@ re@@ sted , what you should do if your animal is sick .
if there &apos;s tension in the village , if atten@@ dance at the schools goes down and there &apos;s a fri@@ ction between the teacher and the parent , the pu@@ p@@ pe@@ t calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says , &quot; shake hands .
you use sign language .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
success story .
and our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dy@@ n@@ am@@ ically v@@ ar@@ ying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration .
you see the el@@ e@@ c@@ tr@@ on flow with the st@@ re@@ am@@ lines we as artists have generated for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there are data on these two groups of people , data on how happy they are .
&quot; i am so much better off physically , fin@@ an@@ ci@@ ally , e@@ mo@@ ti@@ on@@ ally , m@@ ent@@ ally and almost every other way . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t have one minute &apos;s regret .
he wouldn &apos;t l@@ end him the money , and of course six months later ray cro@@ c had exactly the same idea .
in this case , because the experiment i &apos;m going to tell you about uses them , these are mon@@ et pr@@ in@@ ts .
we ga@@ ther@@ ed up our materials and we went out of the room , and co@@ un@@ ted to a half hour .
and i &apos;m going to show you why .
and they blow two of them up , and they have two g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous ei@@ gh@@ t-@@ by-@@ 10 g@@ lo@@ s@@ si@@ es of meaningful things to them , and we say , &quot; which one would you like to give up ? &quot;
we bring in a whole new group of na@@ i@@ ve harvard students and we say , &quot; you know , we &apos;re doing a photography course , and we can do it one of two ways .
night sh@@ ots are beautiful , pi@@ er@@ cing the big di@@ p@@ p@@ er and the m@@ il@@ ky way .
voices : it &apos;s going bal@@ li@@ stic . oh sh@@ it .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
remember , this tradition comes to us not from the mi@@ sts of a@@ val@@ on , back in time , but further still , before we were sc@@ r@@ at@@ ching out these stories on pa@@ p@@ y@@ ru@@ s , or we were doing the p@@ ic@@ to@@ gra@@ ph@@ s on walls in mo@@ ist , d@@ am@@ p ca@@ ves .
that kind of food , yeah .
the kind with the cor@@ ru@@ g@@ ated roof , you know .
and so we left my father fast as@@ le@@ ep , because i knew he &apos;d kill me if i let her go by herself , and we get in the car .
&quot; would this guy have , like , a blue uni@@ form and a ter@@ ri@@ fied look on his face ? &quot;
do i want to walk in , because unless i have ari@@ ad@@ ne &apos;s th@@ re@@ ad to an@@ ch@@ or -- enough me@@ ta@@ ph@@ ors for you ? -- somewhere , i may not get out .
see , we &apos;re a secret club with a secret hand@@ shake .
she says , &quot; ma , you got to look ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m with the little lady . damn ! &quot;
she j@@ um@@ ped out of that car . &quot;
i &apos;m really scared .
so , what is the social result of this ?
where can i go today and who can i do it with ?
and if we have it , you &apos;ll decide how many miles to drive , what mode of travel , where to live and work .
you can look at the ter@@ min@@ al and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street and when it &apos;s coming , and you can buy your ti@@ ck@@ ets in real time .
so , i &apos;d like us to launch the wireless internet inter@@ state wireless m@@ es@@ h system , and require that this network be accessible to everyone , with open standards .
and they got here in the late 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s .
and for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness , you know how challenging it can be .
i said i wanted to tell you the awesome story , i wanted to share with you the three as of awesome , and i wanted to leave you with a clo@@ sing thought .
because you all used to be three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that ro@@ se@@ y gri@@ er is just such an au@@ th@@ en@@ ti@@ c person , and that &apos;s what au@@ th@@ en@@ tic@@ ity is all about .
i was eating o@@ lives with p@@ ie .
you can sleep in clean she@@ ets .
j so many , in fact , that seeing has become a bit of a problem .
and i thought it was astonishing to spe@@ cu@@ late , as if this were a competition , on something that was such a fresh wo@@ un@@ d .
it was pre@@ d@@ om@@ in@@ ant@@ ly a white , rich , corporate group that was not re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative of the city .
it looks like a fairly simple thing , but this was a half a million dollar project ?
and i think people were a@@ ma@@ zed at two things -- i think they were a@@ ma@@ zed at the destruction , but i think there was a sense of dis@@ belief about the her@@ o@@ ics of new y@@ or@@ kers that i found very moving .
because when we looked at the four pl@@ at@@ forms around the site , one of which is an up@@ grade of the families &apos; platform , we knew that these had to be mo@@ ve@@ able to respond to changing conditions , and the changing definition of what ground zero is .
so yeah , i think there is a chance to re-@@ look at how we think about cities .
d@@ r : it was an honor to do .
and i know that kids get con@@ c@@ us@@ sed every year .
if , god for@@ bi@@ d , any of us left here tonight and su@@ sta@@ ined a con@@ c@@ us@@ sion , most of us would go on to fully re@@ co@@ ver inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks .
you have to be familiar with the issues we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turns out , it occurred to tom that a $ 20 h@@ el@@ met is a good way to protect a $ 100,000 graduate education .
this is not accurate , but it did happen to t@@ on@@ y bla@@ i@@ r at the da@@ vo@@ s for@@ um in 2005 , when his do@@ o@@ d@@ les were , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; and he was l@@ ab@@ el@@ ed the following things .
in other words , they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a pre@@ di@@ ct@@ able order .
he was told that a cure did not exist .
today , all countries are ob@@ li@@ ged to provide pat@@ ents for ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ als that last at least 20 years .
it re@@ li@@ es on the wi@@ l@@ l@@ ing@@ ness of ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ al companies to license their pat@@ ents and make them available for others to use .
or@@ land@@ o , same kind of sta@@ di@@ um , op@@ en@@ -@@ air sta@@ di@@ um . people have been sitting in the strong sun , in the very high hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty in the afternoon , and they did not enjoy . it was not comfortable .
they can ad@@ just and find their comfort they need to find .
basically , what he does is , he has all these services for micro@@ -@@ pa@@ y@@ ments and bo@@ o@@ king ti@@ ck@@ ets and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for , but he does it for people o@@ ff@@ line and con@@ ne@@ cts to the digital world .
so we said , &quot; what are the steps required to em@@ power the teacher ? &quot;
let &apos;s see what happens here .
and the daughter &apos;s husband , he also was sick from his wife &apos;s ex@@ h@@ au@@ sti@@ on .
but the visual complexity is still very high .
now , head@@ line writers had a field day with our studies .
now , when we have emotions , we show them .
and you might form the in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion that the un@@ happy people oc@@ cu@@ p@@ y a different st@@ ru@@ c@@ tu@@ ra@@ l location within the network .
that &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
they &apos;re both made of carbon , and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge@@ d in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get gra@@ p@@ hi@@ te , which is soft and dark .
now to put this in perspective , let me just zoom out for a minute .
after all , aging is not a piece of ca@@ ke .
and all things being equal , older people direct their cognitive resources , like attention and memory , to positive information more than negative .
we sa@@ v@@ or life .
those guys made me want to , like , &quot; i &apos;m going to do that mo@@ on@@ walk at that bar mit@@ z@@ va@@ h tonight for that girl . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s kind of like , h@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ ly a lot of times i don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on when i &apos;m dancing .
they &apos;ve called me &quot; brother &quot; and &quot; un@@ c@@ le &quot; and invited me again and again over five years .
18@@ 6@@ 8 : the second for@@ t l@@ ar@@ am@@ ie tre@@ at@@ y clearly gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es the so@@ ver@@ ei@@ g@@ n@@ ty of the great si@@ ou@@ x nation and the la@@ k@@ ot@@ as &apos; o@@ w@@ n@@ er@@ ship of the s@@ ac@@ red black h@@ il@@ l@@ s .
the for@@ t l@@ ar@@ am@@ ie tre@@ at@@ y called for at least three-@@ quar@@ ters of the tri@@ be to sign away land .
they were tired of tre@@ a@@ ties .
teacher tur@@ no@@ ver is eight times higher than the u.s. national average .
so where does that leave us ?
f@@ l@@ as@@ h forward : 1960 , 24 percent child mortality has dropped to 6@@ .@@ 5 percent today .
you get it , either in p@@ il@@ l form or you get it as an in@@ je@@ ction ; you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels .
when we &apos;re dealing with people like this ?
but it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level .
it &apos;s called &quot; are you s@@ mar@@ ter than a fifth gra@@ der ? &quot;
b@@ m@@ w is a pretty safe car .
the problem b@@ m@@ w faces is this car looks safe .
now , you may think to yourself , &quot; well , if my eyes de@@ pen@@ ded on it , you know , i would obviously use it every day . &quot;
we need to combine this with the scientific method .
that &apos;s just a ca@@ ve@@ at . that &apos;s different from actually having an effective ad campaign .
and this is nothing new .
it &apos;ll di@@ m .
we do them for our clients .
we let that lie around in the sun .
now -- -- logic , lo@@ gi@@ cally , you have got to this position from this , without moving the w@@ r@@ ist .
now i will interact . so a different person all the time , so not the same person can answer .
now , if you are interested , i will demonstrate some underground techniques .
so here , to follow my cards , i must look at the sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le from the begin -- ah , we are started together . it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok .
yeah ?
i think ...
l@@ g : par@@ don ?
which card shall i use ? queen or five ?
l@@ g : but you see the hand .
wait , wait , wait -- please take any card .
another suit . l@@ g : di@@ am@@ on@@ ds , perfect .
empathy .
ac@@ e of di@@ am@@ on@@ ds , yes ? zo@@ e : yeah .
so here , all the cards are face down -- you agree ?
and then , king , after exactly five seconds .
i see some of you recognize this child .
i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one-@@ bu@@ t@@ to@@ ck company . &quot;
if you were t@@ on@@ e-@@ de@@ a@@ f , you couldn &apos;t change the ge@@ ars on your car , in a stick shift car .
so let &apos;s see what &apos;s really going on here .
i always tell my students , &quot; if you have a de@@ ce@@ p@@ tive ca@@ den@@ ce , be sure to raise your e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws . then everybody will know . &quot;
bring that person into your mind , and at the same time follow the line all the way from b to e , and you &apos;ll hear everything that ch@@ op@@ in had to say .
now , i had an amazing experience . i was 45 years old , i &apos;d been con@@ du@@ cting for 20 years , and i suddenly had a re@@ ali@@ zation .
she went to au@@ s@@ ch@@ wi@@ t@@ z when she was 15 years old , and her brother was eight , and the parents were lost .
so , ladies and gentlemen of the j@@ ur@@ y , take a look at this .
if you &apos;re the fa@@ st@@ est of everyone we &apos;re testing here today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for 21st century tasks , that me@@ chan@@ i@@ stic , re@@ war@@ d-@@ and@@ -@@ pun@@ is@@ h@@ ment approach doesn &apos;t work , often doesn &apos;t work , and often does harm .
think about your own work .
standard of living is lower .
these are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system for our businesses .
that one day of intense au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ y has produced a whole ar@@ ray of software fi@@ x@@ es that might never have existed .
do it because you like to do it .
the al@@ um@@ in@@ um is because it &apos;s very light .
and then in a series of 5@@ 5 b@@ al@@ l@@ s , it re@@ du@@ ces , pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ at@@ ely -- each ball and the spaces between them reduce pro@@ por@@ ti@@ on@@ at@@ ely , until they get down to this little earth .
and the blue side , the comp@@ li@@ ment , faces the other way .
this has evolved over the years in a lot of different i@@ ter@@ ations .
the de@@ f@@ au@@ lt image on the object would probably be a high-@@ resolution earth image .
but it always leaves behind that 10 percent or more that is most dis@@ ad@@ van@@ ta@@ ged or un@@ lucky .
was 2@@ 3@@ 2,000 dollars , and for a hunger charity , 8@@ 4,000 dollars .
so non@@ pro@@ f@@ its are really rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ant to attempt any bra@@ ve , dar@@ ing , gi@@ ant@@ -@@ scale new f@@ und@@ raising en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ or@@ s for fear that if the thing fa@@ ils , their re@@ pu@@ tations will be dra@@ g@@ ged through the mu@@ d .
what were they to do about this ?
the over@@ head went up .
dan p@@ al@@ l@@ ot@@ ta : the way we think about charity is dead wrong
then you have the c@@ la@@ pping audience , yeah , actually taking part in doing the music .
people who made those stra@@ di@@ v@@ ari@@ us , a@@ ma@@ t@@ i , all those beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible . &quot;
it &apos;s only the ex@@ e@@ cu@@ tion of the written music , no inter@@ pre@@ tation . &quot;
now that &apos;s great . what about the eyes ?
that &apos;s what he does .
you know , when it &apos;s needed , the authority is there . it &apos;s very important .
so k@@ l@@ ei@@ ber is about process .
as a culture , we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future , and where we might move forward from this point .
there are 9@@ 8 o@@ il@@ -@@ producing nations in the world .
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually fe@@ as@@ i@@ ble .
and it &apos;s a process which is really jo@@ y@@ ful .
they are mul@@ ling whether they &apos;re going to take it further .
and the head of the council said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have transition st@@ r@@ ou@@ d , we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but we have a problem .
there &apos;s no real , true bal@@ an@@ cing going on , and in a sense , the games they play to hide that actually ob@@ sc@@ ure the topic so much that people don &apos;t see things that are actually pretty stra@@ ig@@ h@@ t-@@ forward challenges .
in fact , there &apos;s about five states that are worse and only really four states that don &apos;t face this big challenge .
or even if you &apos;re flat , you might shift money into it .
it should be more like private ac@@ co@@ un@@ ting .
but i had an ul@@ ter@@ i@@ or mo@@ tive of vis@@ it@@ ing g@@ ot@@ t@@ fri@@ ed s@@ ch@@ l@@ au@@ g , and it was this : that i was at a cro@@ s@@ s@@ roads in my life , trying to choose between music and medicine .
if you &apos;re l@@ au@@ gh@@ ing , you know what i mean .
many years after the solar powered clo@@ cks project , a young lady i knew su@@ g@@ ge@@ st@@ ed maybe sex is so good because of the five senses .
res@@ po@@ n@@ d@@ ents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level .
now , i realize the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing that makes life interesting .
we are all born artists .
when you have a conversation like this , the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started .
but parents tell them , &quot; it will all be w@@ as@@ h@@ ed away by the waves . &quot;
but kids , usually they do art for fun . it &apos;s playing .
but such a teacher is s@@ el@@ do@@ m found .
in kar@@ a@@ o@@ ke bars , there are always people who sing &quot; she &apos;s gone &quot; or &quot; hotel california , &quot; mi@@ m@@ ing the gu@@ it@@ ar ri@@ ff@@ s .
right this minute , we can turn off tv , lo@@ g off the internet , get up and start to do something .
the students go into a kind of tr@@ ance .
he said it was his pro@@ fi@@ le . &quot; then what are you ? &quot; i asked . &quot; an actor , &quot; he said .
let &apos;s start with how i got to this point .
there will be stronger st@@ or@@ ms and greater f@@ lo@@ o@@ ding .
if so , more warming is in the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine .
but that la@@ g is exactly what is expected .
the economic consequences are almost un@@ th@@ in@@ k@@ able .
a large fra@@ ction of species will be committed to ex@@ tin@@ ction .
it &apos;s critical now that when a car crash happens it isn &apos;t just the st@@ un@@ t person we make safe , it &apos;s the cre@@ w .
well , we used to use tra@@ m@@ p@@ et@@ tes . in the old days , that &apos;s all they had .
but now we have a comp@@ res@@ sed ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en can@@ n@@ on .
that &apos;s all it is , a bo@@ un@@ cy ca@@ st@@ le .
in 1960 , jo@@ se@@ ph k@@ it@@ ten@@ ger of the united states air force did the most spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar thing .
now one of the challenges of going up to al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de is when you get to 3@@ 0,000 feet -- it &apos;s great , isn &apos;t it ? -- when you get to 3@@ 0,000 feet you can really only use oxygen .
and they &apos;ve made a du@@ m@@ my of him . that &apos;s exactly what it looked like .
we expect , and others expect , that perhaps the fa@@ a , the ca@@ a might say , &quot; you need to put someone in a suit that &apos;s not in@@ fl@@ ated , that &apos;s connected to the aircraft . &quot;
there have been three the@@ m@@ es , haven &apos;t there , running through the conference , which are relevant to what i want to talk about .
and the girl said , &quot; they will in a minute . &quot;
the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up . i believe this p@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ at@@ ely , that we don &apos;t grow into creativity , we grow out of it . or rather , we get educated out if it .
everywhere on earth .
the whole system was invented -- around the world , there were no public systems of education , really , before the 19th century .
the brain isn &apos;t divided into com@@ par@@ t@@ ments .
they did bal@@ let ; they did ta@@ p ; they did ja@@ z@@ z ; they did modern ; they did con@@ te@@ m@@ por@@ ary .
it &apos;s still going strong , with positive press to die for .
let &apos;s just say &quot; value for money . &quot;
du@@ ba@@ i , to me , is like a hand that su@@ p@@ por@@ ts anyone who wants to make things happen .
i &apos;d like to end , before going back to the middle east , with a quote from one of the greatest sh@@ ei@@ k@@ h@@ s to put qu@@ il@@ l to par@@ ch@@ ment .
it &apos;s also mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty .
fair enough . they are disorders of behavior , and they are disorders of the mind .
we don &apos;t have all the facts . we don &apos;t actually even know what the tools will be , nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior em@@ er@@ ges as different .
how are you going to re@@ p@@ li@@ c@@ ate ? &quot;
although they are like in different con@@ te@@ x@@ ts , one is ma@@ gi@@ cal , the other two are like inv@@ e@@ st@@ ig@@ ation , i like those books because they have something special in them .
the children have taught them .
they were very friendly .
we also believe that it &apos;s the content that is more important .
i have been changed with my children .
ho@@ ward does the experiment , and he gets the data back , and he pl@@ ots it on a curve , and all of a sudden he re@@ ali@@ zes it &apos;s not a nice bell curve .
this was his h@@ or@@ ser@@ ad@@ ish . he was obsessed with it !
ho@@ ward doesn &apos;t believe that there is such a thing .
it &apos;s what people always say when you ask them what they want in a coffee .
a mu@@ star@@ d of more s@@ op@@ hi@@ st@@ ic@@ ation and culture and meaning .
that &apos;s what it was . and why were we attached to that ?
he got tra@@ ded a couple of times , he ended up in the min@@ ors for most of his career , and he actually ended up in management . he ended up as a general man@@ ag@@ er of the o@@ a@@ k@@ l@@ and a &apos;s .
we all know what happened when millions of women were given h@@ or@@ m@@ one re@@ pl@@ ac@@ em@@ ent therapy for men@@ op@@ au@@ sal symptoms for decades until all of a sudden we realized , because a study came out , a big one , ni@@ h@@ -@@ funded .
thank you .
but dad got really scared : he didn &apos;t want us doing that .
but there &apos;s a middle ground , too .
these are four very different ways of looking at the world . i even gave them names .
what &apos;s interesting is , once you hit print -- and this is from 14@@ 50 , by the way -- all of the ar@@ ti@@ facts of modern com@@ ics start to present themselves : re@@ c@@ ti@@ linear pan@@ el ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge@@ ments , simple line dra@@ w@@ ings without t@@ one and a le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ to-@@ right reading sequence .
and that &apos;s what i pro@@ pos@@ ed : that perhaps we could create these com@@ ics on an infinite can@@ v@@ as : along the x axis and the y axis and sta@@ ir@@ cases .
it &apos;s by a guy named dan@@ i@@ e@@ l mer@@ li@@ n go@@ o@@ d@@ bre@@ y in britain .
now maybe that &apos;s been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i &apos;d en@@ counter@@ ed that exact di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty on a daily basis , i had never seen the in@@ her@@ ent challenge of communication in so cr@@ y@@ st@@ al@@ l@@ ine a light .
now that &apos;s h@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ y and in@@ te@@ gri@@ ty , and it &apos;s also why fe@@ y &apos;s per@@ for@@ man@@ ces left such a la@@ sting im@@ pres@@ sion .
if you have a baby and you think that baby &apos;s gay , you should be allowed to put it up for ad@@ option .
and per@@ ry &apos;s policy solution was to ask the people of texas to pra@@ y for rain .
this song is called &quot; far@@ ther than the sun . &quot;
i &apos;d like to start tonight by something completely different , asking you to join me by ste@@ pping off the land and j@@ um@@ ping into the open ocean for a moment .
they appeared sh@@ or@@ t@@ ly after the dinosaurs disappeared , 65 million years ago , at a time when whales still had legs , and they come from a re@@ bel@@ li@@ ous little pu@@ ff@@ er fish f@@ ac@@ tion -- ob@@ li@@ ge me a little ki@@ pl@@ ing-@@ es@@ que st@@ or@@ y@@ telling here .
and how do you do that ?
the california sea li@@ on takes the m@@ ol@@ as as soon as they come into the bay , ri@@ ps off their fin@@ s , f@@ as@@ hi@@ ons them into the ultimate f@@ r@@ is@@ bee , m@@ ol@@ a style , and then to@@ s@@ ses them back and forth .
i &apos;m going to show you our latest d@@ at@@ as@@ et .
and what i found most exciting is that everyone had a shared -- a shared love and an interest in the oceans .
so as you can see here , this is a , el@@ e@@ v@@ en@@ -@@ inch di@@ am@@ e@@ ter circuit board .
you just don &apos;t hear that every day .
a@@ h@@ -@@ ha@@ h .
if you &apos;re in australia , it &apos;s mostly ab@@ or@@ ig@@ in@@ als who are in jail .
she told him and he set out the first in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y into what today we call do@@ w@@ ry dance .
because nobody can get a ki@@ ck@@ back .
so , why are we not doing something to actually at@@ t@@ end that problem on a day to day basis ?
go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e , ma@@ hat@@ ma g@@ and@@ hi .
can i have my last au@@ di@@ o track please ?
no way , that &apos;s impossible ! no no no no no ! that &apos;s not possible . &quot;
you could do the whole thing with addition .
v@@ on ne@@ um@@ an@@ n , and a lo@@ gi@@ ci@@ an , and a ma@@ the@@ ma@@ ti@@ ci@@ an from the army put this together . then , they needed a place to build it .
the input and the output was by t@@ el@@ et@@ y@@ p@@ e tape at first .
&quot; a@@ ha ! &quot; so , they figured out it &apos;s a code problem .
i know when i &apos;m li@@ cked . &quot;
he would run that thing all night long , running these things , if anybody re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ s ste@@ p@@ h@@ en w@@ ol@@ fra@@ m , who rein@@ v@@ ent@@ ed this stuff .
so there it is , 50 years later , sitting there -- sort of s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded an@@ i@@ ma@@ tion .
sa@@ dly , in the next 18 minutes when i do our ch@@ at , four americans that are alive will be dead from the food that they eat .
this is a global problem .
beautiful town .
and he &apos;s fed up with it . he &apos;s fed up with bur@@ ying his friends , his family , his community .
they want to be self -- they want to self-@@ police themselves .
you know , it &apos;s been kind of in this sort of ti@@ g@@ h@@ t box for a long , long time .
we &apos;re not teaching our kids .
and most kids do .
so , super@@ markets .
if you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
around america , if we just look back now , there is plenty of wonderful things going on .
mis@@ ha gl@@ en@@ ny : an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous , ladies and gentlemen -- a sophisticated group of po@@ li@@ tically mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated ha@@ ck@@ ers who have emerged in 20@@ 11 .
the web links everything , and very soon it will medi@@ ate most human activity .
but interestingly , an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous does not make use of its ha@@ cked information for financial gain .
and he explained to me how in 2003 and 2004 he would go on sp@@ re@@ es in new york , taking out $ 10,000 from an at@@ m here , $ 3@@ 0,000 from an at@@ m there , using c@@ lon@@ ed credit cards .
born in southern germany to a stable and well-@@ res@@ pe@@ cted middle class family , his ob@@ s@@ es@@ sion with gam@@ ing as a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er led him to ha@@ cking .
and most of them , with the ex@@ ce@@ p@@ tion of script and ch@@ a@@ 0 , they did not demonstrate any real social skills in the outside world -- only on the web .
i think there are any number of reasons , and i &apos;m just going to not get into detail but mention a few .
but that they &apos;re really all market driven , and what &apos;s driving the market in particular -- number one -- is major de@@ mo@@ graphic shi@@ f@@ ts .
we also found a lot of examples of dead bi@@ g@@ -@@ box stores that have been conver@@ ted into all sorts of com@@ m@@ un@@ it@@ y-@@ ser@@ ving uses as well -- lots of schools , lots of ch@@ ur@@ ches and lots of li@@ br@@ aries like this one .
eventually , i expect that the streets will probably ex@@ tend through a re@@ development of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful , and it &apos;s helped to pro@@ m@@ p@@ t -- eight of the 13 re@@ gi@@ on@@ al m@@ al@@ l@@ s in den@@ ver have now , or have announced plans to be , retro@@ f@@ it@@ ted .
the cre@@ e@@ k had been cul@@ ver@@ ted under the parking lot .
their populations are more diverse than typical sub@@ ur@@ bi@@ a , but they &apos;re less diverse than cities .
&quot; looking at your v@@ ag@@ in@@ a , &quot; she said , &quot; is a full day &apos;s work . &quot;
but it really didn &apos;t begin there ; it began with a conversation with a woman .
that &apos;s essentially a gender ; that &apos;s essentially a resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a body world , and the species really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real si@@ g@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ ce in us at@@ ta@@ ching our bodies to our heads -- that that se@@ par@@ ation has created a divide that is often se@@ par@@ ating purpose from in@@ t@@ ent .
and i want to tell this little story about my own be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ings because it &apos;s very inter@@ related to happiness and ag@@ n@@ es .
maybe it &apos;s because my native state of south car@@ ol@@ in@@ a , which is not much smaller than pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day h@@ un@@ g@@ ary , once imagined a future for itself as an independent country .
well , maybe he was too tru@@ sting , because he stayed where he was long after the na@@ z@@ i an@@ s@@ ch@@ l@@ us@@ s in au@@ stri@@ a and even after the ar@@ re@@ sts and de@@ por@@ tations began in bu@@ da@@ p@@ est .
he got the same answer : &quot; you bring the best workers that you can find , and if they are good enough , i will hire them . &quot;
and just as clearly , it is saying , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
&quot; a@@ ha ! &quot; said dr. ro@@ bi@@ c@@ se@@ k . &quot; i went to the movie all by myself . &quot;
as i said , he s@@ wor@@ e too much .
and you can just imagine them .
they know what they &apos;re looking for .
but we take the severe ones , and we res@@ che@@ du@@ le the other ones the next day .
so we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother also , &#91; during the &#93; time of &#91; the &#93; soviet union .
and really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
and what i &apos;m going to try -- i hope i make the following points .
and as i will point out later in the presentation , 50 percent of the united states of america lies ben@@ e@@ at@@ h the sea .
it &apos;s absolutely pit@@ ch black , because ph@@ ot@@ ons cannot reach the average de@@ p@@ th of the ocean , which is 1@@ 2@@ ,000 feet . in the ri@@ ft valley , it &apos;s 9@@ ,000 feet .
and so we went along this mountain range , in an area along g@@ al@@ a@@ pa@@ go@@ s ri@@ ft , and did we find the missing heat .
so , i began designing a new technology of tele@@ presence , using robotic systems to re@@ p@@ li@@ c@@ ate myself , so i wouldn &apos;t have to cycle my vehicle system .
finding the state of pres@@ er@@ v@@ ation .
and i was looking at it yesterday , it &apos;s up in se@@ at@@ t@@ le . ok .
but i will let a kid with no license take over control of my vehicle system .
in some parts of the world , for example , south africa , education is just not re@@ a@@ di@@ ly accessible .
so , having seen the impact of this , and@@ re@@ w and i decided that we needed to really try and scale this up , to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could .
so what made these c@@ ou@@ r@@ ses so different ?
every few minutes , the video p@@ au@@ s@@ es and the students get asked a question .
so we tried to convince , for example , some of our hu@@ man@@ i@@ ties f@@ ac@@ ul@@ ty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy .
and in the context of particular c@@ ou@@ r@@ ses , you can ask questions like , what are some of the mis@@ con@@ ce@@ p@@ tions that are more common and how do we help students fix them ?
and even per@@ son@@ alization whether it &apos;s via the per@@ son@@ alized tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory through the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um or some of the per@@ son@@ alized feedback that we &apos;ve shown you .
i was thinking about my place in the universe , and about my first thought about what in@@ fin@@ ity might mean , when i was a child .
and of course we live in a society that &apos;s all about con@@ tra@@ di@@ cting other pe@@ op@@ les &apos; reality .
i have questions with the values of new@@ t@@ on@@ ian science , like ra@@ ti@@ on@@ ality . you &apos;re supposed to be rational in an argument .
so you can imagine my surprise on reading in the new y@@ or@@ ker that al@@ an gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an , ch@@ a@@ ir@@ man of the federal res@@ er@@ ve , c@@ la@@ im@@ s a@@ y@@ n r@@ and as his intellectual m@@ ent@@ or .
i think you can make fun of the have but not the ha@@ v@@ e-@@ n@@ ots , which is why you don &apos;t see me making fun of k@@ en@@ ne@@ th lay and his char@@ m@@ ing wife .
i really miss the old t@@ el@@ em@@ ar@@ ke@@ ters now , i &apos;ll tell you that .
and he said that i had to show more respect because it took up to 18 years to learn how to do mi@@ me properly .
hu@@ h ? hu@@ h ? what ? can &apos;t hear you . &quot;
and i s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct , by someone who ac@@ tively dis@@ likes us .
i was thinking about what mo@@ she sa@@ f@@ die said yesterday about beauty because in his book , hy@@ de says that sometimes tri@@ ck@@ ster can ti@@ p over into beauty .
president george w@@ . bush : whatever it costs to de@@ f@@ end our security , and whatever it costs to de@@ f@@ end our freedom , we must pay it .
ten years ago , you couldn &apos;t have found an a@@ st@@ r@@ on@@ om@@ er -- well , very few a@@ st@@ r@@ on@@ om@@ ers -- in the world who would &apos;ve told you that there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are in real , real danger .
one of the things he ra@@ ved about was that a particle ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ator experiment could go ha@@ y@@ wire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world .
we treat bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ gy with the same sc@@ ru@@ tiny we apply to nuclear power plants .
obviously , we don &apos;t want one of those .
so , what can we do about it ?
and this is my sc@@ ari@@ est .
we spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don &apos;t die in airplane accidents , and we &apos;re not spending hardly anything on this . and yet , this is completely pre@@ v@@ ent@@ able .
we don &apos;t want to get caught fl@@ at@@ -@@ fo@@ ot@@ ed again .
i hope it will be .
this is very , very important because this is the system , this is the cru@@ ci@@ ble , out of which life on the planet came , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an astonishing insight , and we have only found out about this recently .
and this is what the system involves , a number of sites in the southern he@@ mis@@ p@@ here , shown in those circles .
so anyone coming along later simply ac@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ es the d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase and can draw down the information they need about anything that has taken place .
we &apos;re about to ride the wave of technological opportunity .
when ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ k@@ es take place , massive amounts of these new microbes we &apos;ve never seen before come out of the sea floor .
o@@ ce@@ an@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ er john del@@ an@@ ey is leading the team that is building an underwater network of high-@@ de@@ f cameras and sen@@ s@@ ors that will turn our ocean into a global interactive lab -- spar@@ king an explo@@ sion of rich data about the world below .
and i therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward .
so again , radical versus con@@ ser@@ va@@ tive .
in@@ ex@@ p@@ li@@ cable versus understood . you know , too often we want to understand everything .
our intellectual des@@ ir@@ es are complex .
you know , it &apos;s true , the ca@@ the@@ dr@@ als , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i rather play something completely un@@ heard of , and even with fla@@ ws , than re@@ pe@@ at the same thing over and over which has been h@@ ol@@ lo@@ wed by its me@@ an@@ ing@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ness .
risks of spaces that have never been so di@@ zz@@ ying , as they should be , for a pi@@ on@@ e@@ ering city .
there are emotions of the victims .
dan@@ i@@ e@@ l li@@ b@@ es@@ kind bu@@ il@@ ds on very big ideas . here , he shares 17 words that under@@ lie his vision for architecture -- raw , ris@@ ky , emotional , radical -- and that offer inspiration for any b@@ old creative pur@@ suit .
and then it also has the lo@@ west dra@@ g co@@ efficient of any car of its size .
do you see that coming , really , truly , or just on a few key r@@ ou@@ tes ?
em : it must , actually . if it doesn &apos;t , we &apos;re in deep trouble .
with that capital , sol@@ ar@@ city pur@@ ch@@ ases and in@@ st@@ al@@ l@@ s the pan@@ el on the roof and then char@@ ges the hom@@ e@@ o@@ w@@ ner or business o@@ w@@ ner a mon@@ th@@ ly le@@ ase pa@@ y@@ ment , which is less than the u@@ ti@@ li@@ ty bill .
we came very close to failure , but we managed to get through that point in 2008 .
it &apos;s much like on a je@@ t .
how on earth has one person been able to in@@ no@@ v@@ ate in this way ?
look at that .
boy , if you are looking after our li@@ ve@@ stock and you see a che@@ et@@ ah eating our go@@ at -- che@@ et@@ ah is very nervous -- just walk up to it .
we were hungry .
here is our tradition : at every hi@@ m@@ b@@ a village , there is a s@@ ac@@ red fire .
and so far , with the support of world wil@@ d@@ life fund , we &apos;ve been able to scale up the very small programs to national programs today .
very important as well -- we invest this money in aids and hiv education .
wal@@ let gu@@ i@@ des -- standard issue by lots in the marine conservation world -- are very hand@@ y ; they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
and we are hi@@ ding that cost behind mon@@ ster pro@@ f@@ its .
dan bar@@ ber and ali@@ ce w@@ at@@ ers are leading p@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ at@@ ely the green food de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous revolution .
sh@@ ell@@ fish , m@@ us@@ s@@ el@@ s , o@@ y@@ sters , cl@@ am@@ s , ti@@ la@@ pi@@ a , ch@@ ar -- these were the common species .
it &apos;s like a han@@ go@@ ver from protein .
science ten@@ ds to look at the world through the rational , the qu@@ anti@@ ta@@ tive -- things that can be measured and described -- but it gives art a ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ c context of understanding .
well , within about three weeks , i in@@ c@@ au@@ ti@@ ously turned that idea of a couple of ti@@ me@@ -@@ la@@ p@@ se cameras into 25 ti@@ me@@ -@@ la@@ p@@ se cameras .
that &apos;s the natural cycle .
this is something no self-@@ res@@ pe@@ cting photographer would ever do -- you put some che@@ es@@ y il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tion on your shot , right ? -- and yet you have to do it sometimes to nar@@ rate these points .
and here , if you watch , you can see the ter@@ min@@ us re@@ treating .
this is what a couple of the cameras saw .
could india become a source , or a global hu@@ b , of innovation , just like it &apos;s become a global hu@@ b for back office services and software development ?
when we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on , they said , &quot; we are working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor without having been a student .
best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment , bi@@ r@@ ths , st@@ ro@@ kes , heart disease , hip re@@ pl@@ ac@@ em@@ ents , 4 a@@ .@@ m@@ . em@@ er@@ gen@@ cies .
it works a little something like -- this is a recent google search for four in the morning .
i said , i know a co@@ ded message when i see one .
everybody in our society &apos;s life is touched by cancer -- if not personally , then through a loved one , a family member , col@@ le@@ a@@ gue , friend .
and in that space station we have the genetic material , the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es , within a nu@@ c@@ le@@ us .
we &apos;ve applied tumor treating fields to over 20 different can@@ c@@ ers in the lab , and we see this effect in all of them .
he received the standard treatments .
but what we can see is , by month six , the tumor has res@@ po@@ n@@ ded and it &apos;s be@@ gun to m@@ el@@ t away .
it &apos;s only the beginning .
this is a new work , it &apos;s a new program .
in fact they go 15 feet deep , and collect rain water from roof , there is a small pi@@ pe , and from their c@@ ou@@ r@@ t@@ y@@ ard .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , soon it become like this .
somewhere a stream or a ri@@ v@@ u@@ let is running through here .
this is called k@@ un@@ d . we have , in english , surface water and ground water .
and you have to go further down .
these are the beautiful sta@@ ir@@ s which we just saw in one of the slides .
and hiv in@@ fe@@ ction rates are down 27 percent : 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 less people a year are getting hiv in sub-@@ sa@@ har@@ an africa .
ten percent &apos;s come from india .
they will get the te@@ x@@ ti@@ les jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to in@@ du@@ stri@@ alization and wealth .
and the countries on the right hand side , you &apos;ll see the per capita gdp , basically every country with a per capita gdp of , say , less than 5,000 dollars , has got a corruption score of roughly , what &apos;s that , about three ?
actually , for the first 20 years , the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india didn &apos;t really grow .
buy african products .
but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should be dro@@ pping i@@ po@@ ds not b@@ om@@ bs -- i mean , it would make a fascinating title for thomas f@@ ri@@ e@@ d@@ man &apos;s new book .
so 500 people applied , and four were s@@ el@@ e@@ cted to actually go and tour the facility in question , and th@@ us in@@ spe@@ ct it and then blog about it .
so having people involved in planning for 20@@ 20 is not necessarily going to change anything , because the di@@ c@@ t@@ at@@ ors are still the ones who control the agenda .
e@@ v@@ gen@@ y mor@@ o@@ zo@@ v : how the net aids di@@ c@@ t@@ at@@ or@@ ships
like a man .
and he was hanging out with all us younger guys .
because for me growing up at that time , and our relationship with this man box , &quot; do you want some ? &quot; meant one of two things : sex or drugs -- and we weren &apos;t doing drugs .
folks , i &apos;m pet@@ ri@@ fied .
as an indian , and now as a po@@ li@@ ti@@ ci@@ an and a government minister , i &apos;ve become rather concerned about the h@@ y@@ p@@ e we &apos;re hearing about our own country , all this talk about india becoming a world leader , even the next super@@ power .
in other words , all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries , whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories .
but , li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning struck rather slowly in our country in those days , so , it was like about a half an hour for a li@@ gh@@ t@@ ning call to come through .
she can &apos;t understand the di@@ al@@ o@@ gue .
this can sometimes have un@@ in@@ ten@@ ded consequences . ok .
and those of you who cas@@ hed your money here might be surprised to see how many sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ts there are on the ru@@ pe@@ e note , sp@@ ell@@ ing out the den@@ om@@ in@@ ations .
so i went home , and i did a little research , and i found some very sho@@ cking statistics .
lu@@ d@@ wi@@ ck mar@@ is@@ han@@ e : a bat@@ h without water
and i feel now like george bush .
now that title , that phrase , comes from a cri@@ tic , an early cri@@ tic , and this is a p@@ as@@ sa@@ ge that i just love , and would like to read for you .
and it &apos;s a good thing that there isn &apos;t , because if there were , then mother nature would have a problem : how on earth do you get ch@@ im@@ ps to mate ?
this is the hard one , the one that isn &apos;t obvious . that &apos;s why i leave it to the end .
ok ? stop . all right , now .
don &apos;t know the reason for the p@@ ink fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , but anyway , they &apos;re there in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i s@@ us@@ pe@@ ct , actually , that the evolutionary biologists probably have lots of reasons &#91; for &#93; why we want to cat@@ e@@ g@@ ori@@ ze new things very , very quickly .
so it should look like this . you should be looking at something like this .
so now , bo@@ b m@@ ck@@ im did another version of this test in a rather famous experiment that was done in the 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s .
and we &apos;ve certainly le@@ ar@@ n@@ t that over time , you get much better bra@@ in@@ st@@ or@@ m@@ ing , much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules .
and all of a sudden a productive conversation was happening about design around a tan@@ gi@@ ble object .
they can be a little s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic@@ al ; i &apos;ll come back to that .
and you know what it feels like : all of that un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty while you &apos;re left out in the h@@ al@@ l@@ way while the do@@ cs are dealing with some more ur@@ g@@ ent case in one of the emergency rooms , wondering what the he@@ ck &apos;s going on .
as a result , we &apos;d all feel perfectly secure and have a good time -- but because we all understood the rules and we agreed on them together .
so we do everything that leads up to success , but then we get there . we figure we &apos;ve made it , we sit back in our comfort zone , and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful .
i was faster but just as depressed .
i learned that success isn &apos;t a one-@@ way street .
and the s@@ op@@ ran@@ o section is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; om@@ g , &quot; hopefully for the last time in public ever .
he made sure that everything lin@@ ed up .
and there were 9@@ 0@@ 0 people involved in that .
and the second is that people seem to be ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ cing an actual connection .
it is questions .
as you see in today &apos;s modern liberal de@@ mo@@ cra@@ cies , the society , the state , not only allows us to determine our self , to shape our self , it also de@@ m@@ and@@ s it of us .
it means living up to your own full potential as a human being .
so these are the kinds of layers , the kinds of questions i wanted to lead you through today -- the question of , what are the in@@ ten@@ tions that you bring to bear when you &apos;re designing something ?
so my co-@@ teacher , se@@ ba@@ sti@@ an th@@ run , and i thought , there must be a better way .
and we su@@ c@@ ce@@ e@@ ded .
i &apos;ll do one in the fall .
he wi@@ g@@ gl@@ es it in place , tu@@ gs it with his nose , and s@@ mas@@ h .
and we were in for our first surprise .
there needs to be some kind of sp@@ r@@ ing-@@ lo@@ ad@@ ed mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we ob@@ ser@@ ve , and the speed that we ob@@ ser@@ ve , and the output of the system .
a load cell me@@ as@@ ur@@ es forces , and this is actually a p@@ i@@ e@@ zo@@ electronic load cell that has a little cr@@ y@@ st@@ al in it .
there &apos;s that ra@@ p@@ t@@ ori@@ al app@@ en@@ da@@ ge -- there &apos;s the he@@ el , and it &apos;s going to s@@ wing around and hit the load cell .
very , very con@@ ven@@ i@@ ent solution to that particular problem .
and ha@@ w@@ kes : &quot; it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean . &quot;
this , i think , represents one of the most beautiful classic sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles built .
i don &apos;t know of any other sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , or even remote , that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space .
now , look at that ; look , it &apos;s -- she just ble@@ w me away .
so the su@@ b that was outside last year -- this is the one .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , the idea of architecture as this sort of object in the field , de@@ vo@@ id of context , is really not the -- excuse me , it &apos;s fairly bl@@ at@@ ant -- is really not the approach that we need to take .
basically , new york was built on the backs of o@@ y@@ st@@ er@@ men , and our streets were literally built over o@@ y@@ ster sh@@ ell@@ s .
you can see the eight ch@@ am@@ ber@@ s on the side host little baby o@@ y@@ sters and essentially for@@ ce@@ -@@ feed them .
so , you would just walk around london at this point and just be over@@ wh@@ el@@ med with this st@@ en@@ ch .
and eventually snow made a map of the out@@ break .
and this happens every two weeks .
i took her por@@ tra@@ it up on top of the jo@@ k@@ hang te@@ m@@ p@@ le .
and this area of the e@@ cu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an amazon -- oil was discovered in 19@@ 7@@ 2 .
in fact , on that other side is the area , tor@@ a bor@@ a , the area where o@@ s@@ am@@ a bin la@@ den &apos;s supposed to be . this is the tri@@ b@@ al area .
that was one of the big mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ating factors .
so that &apos;s sort of the part , and let me move on then and show you the hu@@ b@@ ble ul@@ tr@@ a deep field .
but you get out to ju@@ pit@@ er and it &apos;s 40 minutes away . it &apos;s a problem .
and that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies , right ?
so the stuff that &apos;s in this picture that &apos;s white , that is the dark matter .
and so you know when you first saw this picture , it didn &apos;t mean quite so much to you .
this si@@ mu@@ lation was run on 1,000 pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ors for a month in order to make just this simple visible one .
but what we &apos;re hoping when we get to pl@@ an@@ ck , we &apos;ll have resolution about equivalent to the resolution you see of the earth there , where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the earth .
the result , of course , is that we get st@@ res@@ sed .
for@@ t@@ y-@@ seven percent .
you know , this is crazy . we do this all the time , even on an everyday level .
and this became a vi@@ ci@@ ous cycle that ended up causing so much pain and jo@@ in@@ t issues , i had trouble holding anything .
i wondered , could you become more creative , then , by looking for li@@ mit@@ ations ?
it did not happen over@@ night .
you have to have do@@ si@@ meter at all times , cli@@ cking away , you have to have a government min@@ der , and there &apos;s dra@@ con@@ ian radiation rules and constant con@@ t@@ am@@ ination mon@@ it@@ or@@ ing .
st@@ al@@ in &apos;s en@@ forced f@@ am@@ ines of the 19@@ 3@@ 0@@ s , the h@@ ol@@ o@@ d@@ om@@ or , killed millions of u@@ k@@ ra@@ in@@ i@@ ans , and they faced the na@@ z@@ is in the &apos; 4@@ 0@@ s , who came through s@@ l@@ as@@ hing , burning , ra@@ ping , and in fact many of these women were shi@@ pped to germany as forced labor .
they are dying of sa@@ dness . &quot;
and , as a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ist , what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves , about our identity , to live better lives in the real world .
we &apos;re getting used to a new way of being alone together .
human relationships are rich and they &apos;re m@@ es@@ s@@ y and they &apos;re de@@ m@@ and@@ ing .
it com@@ for@@ ted her .
because the moment that people are alone , even for a few seconds , they become an@@ x@@ i@@ ous , they pan@@ ic , they fi@@ d@@ get , they reach for a device .
but we &apos;re at risk , because actually it &apos;s the opposite that &apos;s true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but it seemed that we didn &apos;t win each individual game by the mar@@ g@@ in that some of our al@@ um@@ n@@ i had pre@@ di@@ cted and quite fre@@ qu@@ ently i -- -- quite fre@@ qu@@ ently i really felt that they had bac@@ ked up their predictions in a more ma@@ ter@@ i@@ ali@@ stic man@@ ner .
maybe it &apos;s because dad used to read to us at night .
so i let them -- just they had to be ne@@ at and clean .
i came up with a pyramid eventually , that i don &apos;t have the time to go on that .
yet losing , not afraid to fall , if bra@@ vely we have given all . for who can ask more of a man than giving all within his sp@@ an .
i can never answer that , as far as the individuals are concerned .
have i ra@@ m@@ bl@@ ed enough ?
the second challenge was cells .
now today , many clinical trials are using different kinds of stem cells for heart disease .
and we now have been able just to show the creation of human liver tissue just this past month using this technology .
we then are able to actually image those , do 3@@ 60 degree ro@@ tation to an@@ al@@ y@@ ze the ki@@ d@@ ne@@ y in its full v@@ ol@@ u@@ me@@ tri@@ c characteristics , and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a printing com@@ pu@@ ter@@ i@@ zed form .
i was missing school . it was pretty much mis@@ er@@ able .
i was a little kid , and i was like , &quot; yeah . i &apos;ll have that . i &apos;ll have that surgery . &quot;
now you may have noticed there &apos;s a new sector emerging called s@@ wa@@ p@@ -@@ tra@@ ding .
and linked to this crowd man@@ ia were examples all around the world -- from the election of a president to the in@@ famous wikipedia , and everything in between -- on what the power of numbers could achieve .
three , pres@@ sing un@@ res@@ ol@@ ved environmental con@@ c@@ er@@ n@@ s .
because what you need is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a c@@ d ; i want the music it plays .
my name is jo@@ se@@ ph , a member of par@@ li@@ am@@ ent in kenya .
we have to fle@@ e our women and children , we have to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
and i drove home late that night with bat@@ ter@@ i@@ es and ice .
together : someone get me post-@@ its !
co : i decided to stay in the country , give up the master &apos;s in mo@@ s@@ cow and to work f@@ ul@@ l@@ -@@ time to make this happen .
now that ex@@ pen@@ se can be huge , but if the town can mo@@ bi@@ li@@ ze x amount of volunteers for y hours , the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town &apos;s con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion .
they have hot@@ lines and sp@@ re@@ ad@@ she@@ ets and data .
so , that &apos;ll be -- in the 18 minutes that i &apos;m given to talk here , between two and three thousand people will have j@@ ou@@ r@@ ne@@ yed to the cities .
and it was set in a wi@@ der w@@ at@@ er@@ y o@@ o@@ ze .
the buildings here are multi@@ -@@ story .
those green things in the fore@@ ground are man@@ goes .
and when you &apos;re a legal sub-@@ m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ ality , you suddenly have politics .
little did i know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true .
but think of it . these men , who hadn &apos;t had the educational opportunities i &apos;d had , helped me gain post-@@ graduate qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ ca@@ tions in law by their dedicated help .
op@@ tic@@ al character recognition units then only op@@ er@@ ated usually on one f@@ on@@ t , but by using char@@ ge@@ -@@ c@@ ou@@ pl@@ ed device fl@@ at@@ bed sc@@ an@@ ners and speech sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ z@@ ers , he developed a machine that could read any f@@ on@@ t .
but , you know , i find reading with machines a very lon@@ ely process .
well , because we can &apos;t transport books across borders , there had to be separate ver@@ sions read in all the different en@@ g@@ li@@ sh@@ -@@ speaking countries : britain , united states , canada , australia , and new z@@ e@@ al@@ and all had to have separate re@@ ad@@ ings of har@@ ry po@@ t@@ ter .
the average li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an &apos;s more than d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed since 18@@ 40 , and it &apos;s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day .
and one final thing . wish people like me lu@@ ck , okay ?
the second reason that the new machine age is such great news is that , once the and@@ ro@@ i@@ ds start doing jobs , we don &apos;t have to do them anymore , and we get fre@@ ed up from d@@ ru@@ d@@ ger@@ y and to@@ il .
the soci@@ et@@ al challenges that come along with that kind of ine@@ quality des@@ er@@ ve some attention .
the economic pla@@ y@@ book is sur@@ pris@@ ingly clear , sur@@ pris@@ ingly stra@@ ig@@ h@@ t@@ forward , in the short term especially .
and my biggest worry is that we &apos;re creating a world where we &apos;re going to have g@@ li@@ t@@ ter@@ ing technologies embedded in kind of a s@@ h@@ ab@@ by society and su@@ p@@ por@@ ted by an economy that gener@@ ates ine@@ quality instead of opportunity .
i have become more and more un@@ comfortable with this perception of god over the years .
some have con@@ c@@ lu@@ ded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain .
in the second ver@@ se comes the line , &quot; the wind and waves o@@ be@@ y him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the great pu@@ p@@ p@@ et@@ -@@ master or the tri@@ b@@ al prote@@ ctor ?
the lo@@ ving soul of the universe .
by se@@ e@@ king the god within . by cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ating my own in@@ war@@ dness .
and one of the first things that i started to inv@@ e@@ st@@ ig@@ ate was the history of the name of technology .
there are no ne@@ an@@ der@@ th@@ al fo@@ s@@ si@@ ls that are older than 40 years old that we &apos;ve ever found , and the average age of most of these h@@ un@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ er tribes is 20 to 30 .
our bodies have a@@ da@@ p@@ ted to these new di@@ ets .
so , those energy , matter einstein show were equivalent , and now new s@@ ci@@ en@@ ces of quantum computing show that ent@@ ro@@ p@@ y and information and matter and energy are all inter@@ related , so it &apos;s one long con@@ tin@@ u@@ um .
this is a robot that wants to pl@@ u@@ g itself in to get more power .
and what i mean by that is that we find a new job for it .
great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go , and our choice , so to speak , in technology , is really to al@@ ig@@ n ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves .
and they would say , &quot; well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each .
we took all that down , and we found beautiful wo@@ o@@ den flo@@ ors , wh@@ it@@ e@@ w@@ as@@ h@@ ed be@@ am@@ s and it had the look -- while we were ren@@ o@@ v@@ ating this place , somebody said , &quot; you know , it really kind of looks like the h@@ ul@@ l of a ship . &quot;
and so we wa@@ ited , we sat at the t@@ ab@@ les , we wa@@ ited and wa@@ ited .
there &apos;s a lot of cro@@ s@@ s-@@ po@@ l@@ l@@ ination . the only problem , especially for the adults working at mc@@ swe@@ en@@ ey &apos;s who hadn &apos;t necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up , was that there was just the one ba@@ th@@ room .
the teachers that we work with -- and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do .
i think we had about 1@@ 70 tu@@ t@@ ors that worked on this book with them and so this worked out incredibly well .
and then right beyond -- there &apos;s usually a little chain there -- right beyond , they would see the kids being tu@@ tor@@ ed .
so then , the secret door -- this is one of the sh@@ el@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly opens .
he &apos;s e@@ v@@ an@@ ge@@ li@@ cal about it . he brings his c@@ ou@@ s@@ ins in now .
you email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
i was that girl .
ei@@ gh@@ ty percent of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es around the world are women and children . oh .
there is a side that thinks that peace is the end of fighting , and there is a side that thinks that peace is the ar@@ ri@@ val of schools and jobs .
she was sending them to school . have a new home .
you know , there &apos;s also something called the &quot; complete i@@ di@@ o@@ t &apos;s guide ? &quot;
and cap@@ e co@@ d , there are i@@ dy@@ l@@ li@@ c roads , and all of us can drive in this room .
that &apos;s my baby rein@@ a . thank you .
he basically said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and i &apos;ve always felt bad about it , in a sense .
so , this is sort of a comp@@ li@@ cation i &apos;ve found .
i discovered that che@@ et@@ os are good , ex@@ pres@@ sive material .
you know the un@@ i is the most challenging , so number ten is challenging .
from everything from a weird hotel lo@@ b@@ by , to s@@ ar@@ an w@@ ra@@ p placed over your window , to this moment where i had my road in front of my house pa@@ ved dark black , and this white m@@ ot@@ h was sitting there dying in the sun .
and i was re@@ min@@ ded by kar@@ en ar@@ m@@ strong &apos;s fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief , but about behavior .
the north polar ice cap is the same size geo@@ gra@@ p@@ hi@@ cally -- doesn &apos;t look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the united states , min@@ us an area roughly equal to the state of ari@@ z@@ on@@ a .
but it &apos;s not just the developed nations .
we can &apos;t wait for the kind of dr@@ ought australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c of our whole civilization .
a new app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation for the privilege that we have of under@@ taking this challenge .
and before i launch into the display of some of the slides and into the pre@@ view , i would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design .
the r@@ ca is really quite an amazing school from that vi@@ e@@ w@@ point .
we were dis@@ c@@ us@@ sing with k@@ ei@@ th s@@ h@@ r@@ u@@ b@@ b * this morning the fact that many scientists tend not to use anything beautiful in their pres@@ ent@@ ations , otherwise they &apos;re afraid of being considered du@@ m@@ b bl@@ on@@ des .
but here instead are examples , you can already 3@@ d-@@ print te@@ x@@ ti@@ les , which is very interesting .
so it &apos;s really a way to make us think more about what robots mean to us .
no . so i had to think a little harder .
we did this exact same thing for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to face as ph@@ y@@ si@@ ci@@ sts .
we can push it up : the forces become more fra@@ g@@ m@@ ent@@ ed ; there is more of them , but they are we@@ a@@ k@@ er .
naturally 7 : a f@@ ul@@ l@@ -@@ band be@@ at@@ box
and there are some charity workers who call this compassion fa@@ ti@@ gue .
the idea of justice , which gives boundaries to our lives and gives us a feeling of what &apos;s right about life , what &apos;s right about living , what should we be doing , social justice .
and , as many people do , he was do@@ zing off during the ser@@ m@@ on .
every week , the c@@ le@@ an@@ er would come . &quot; god you &apos;ve an@@ s@@ w@@ er@@ ed my ple@@ a again . &quot;
it &apos;s the sy@@ m@@ p@@ tom of a tumor or an in@@ fe@@ ction or an in@@ fl@@ am@@ ma@@ tion or an operation .
the muscles were frozen , par@@ al@@ y@@ zed -- dy@@ st@@ on@@ ic is how we re@@ f@@ er to that .
we treat them with sy@@ m@@ p@@ t@@ om@@ -@@ mo@@ di@@ fying drugs -- pa@@ in@@ k@@ il@@ l@@ ers -- which are , frankly , not very effective for this kind of pain .
then you &apos;re starting to get an idea of how much rock we &apos;re talking about , okay ?
it was 19@@ 0@@ 8 . that &apos;s fine . i can live with that .
i don &apos;t even know if you can see that in the back row . these are just stars .
in the year 2005 , nasa launched a pro@@ be called deep impact , which s@@ lam@@ med into -- s@@ lam@@ med a piece of itself into the nu@@ c@@ le@@ us of a com@@ et .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- a@@ st@@ r@@ on@@ au@@ ts , like i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote , and so we can change our future .
at that time i was running b@@ 9@@ 2 , the only independent , for that matter the only electronic media , in the country .
and i thought that b@@ 9@@ 2 will survive and be a great company once mi@@ lo@@ se@@ vi@@ c is gone , which turned out to be true .
at the end of the meeting he says , look , it is not going to work ; you will never see your money back ; but my fo@@ un@@ da@@ tions will put 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars so you can test the idea .
and we said , that &apos;s fine ; let &apos;s meet ; you &apos;ll bring us your business plan , which eventually they did .
you see we started working in eastern and central europe , and moved to russia .
somewhere down the road we opened a media management center .
and we came up with this idea of is@@ su@@ ing bon@@ ds , press freedom bon@@ ds .
and in that way you organize the fin@@ an@@ cing so there are no dark rooms , no blind people running around to find each other .
now , why does stuff like that work ? that &apos;s the question .
now , some people call that a theory of everything .
a tri@@ vi@@ al example is this : new@@ ton found the law of gravity , which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gra@@ vi@@ t@@ ated .
the more and more symmetry you have , the better you ex@@ hi@@ bit the simplicity and el@@ e@@ g@@ an@@ ce of the theory .
one thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today , but in his day it wasn &apos;t taken for granted .
it doesn &apos;t di@@ min@@ ish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things , plus accidents .
but he read books in every sp@@ are moment he could find .
so fu@@ el@@ ed by that am@@ bi@@ tion , he returned to the state le@@ g@@ is@@ l@@ at@@ ure .
but as he was about to put his si@@ g@@ nature on the pro@@ c@@ la@@ ma@@ tion his own hand was nu@@ m@@ b and sha@@ king because he had sha@@ ken a thousand hands that morning at a new year &apos;s re@@ ce@@ p@@ tion .
not that pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar -- there were only three women out of the 16 white house f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws .
but i must say , the older i &apos;ve gotten , the more i realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging li@@ on of a man .
and as lin@@ col@@ n told the story , mr. al@@ l@@ en went to britain after the war .
so i went to my father in te@@ ars , &quot; what are we going to do ? &quot;
which is why , in the end , i shall always be gr@@ at@@ e@@ ful for this curious love of history , allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past .
he &apos;d r@@ an@@ s@@ ac@@ ked , des@@ e@@ cr@@ ated the te@@ m@@ p@@ le .
this is the de@@ cre@@ e , this object is the evidence for the fact that the je@@ ws , after the ex@@ i@@ le in b@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on , the years they &apos;d spent sitting by the w@@ at@@ ers of b@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on , we@@ e@@ ping when they re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed j@@ er@@ us@@ al@@ em , those je@@ ws were allowed to go home .
all of those are res@@ pe@@ cted by cy@@ ru@@ s .
the b@@ ab@@ y@@ lon@@ ian cy@@ lin@@ der is written by the p@@ ri@@ e@@ sts of the great god of b@@ ab@@ l@@ y@@ on , mar@@ du@@ k .
you all know what happened .
to see this object in te@@ h@@ r@@ an , thousands of je@@ ws living in iran came to te@@ h@@ r@@ an to see it .
others know more about the living conditions there , but still think they &apos;re a necessary evil .
the new@@ ly ad@@ mit@@ ted babies would cry for the first few hours , but their de@@ m@@ and@@ s were not met , and so eventually they learned not to bo@@ ther . within a few days , they were li@@ st@@ less , le@@ th@@ ar@@ gi@@ c , and star@@ ing into space like all the others .
one study suggests that a family support service costs 10 percent of an in@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tional pl@@ ac@@ em@@ ent , wh@@ il@@ st good quality fo@@ ster care costs usually about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i &apos;d been m@@ es@@ s@@ ing around with a camera most of my life .
you very quickly work out what is it that you &apos;ve got to do to fa@@ th@@ o@@ m that out .
there were 1@@ 14 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family .
and we were listening to everybody .
and obviously he never came down . the statement was never made .
and after lots and lots of meetings obviously , i &apos;m de@@ li@@ gh@@ ted that this man , a@@ h@@ mad fa@@ w@@ z@@ i , one of my heroes and m@@ ent@@ ors really , he managed to get un@@ ic@@ e@@ f involved .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it , etc . , etc . -- and they made it real .
lin@@ king up with the ol@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ics -- i went and saw se@@ b co@@ e . i said , &quot; london 20@@ 12 is about tru@@ ce .
it &apos;s about your con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ en@@ cies ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
so the largest brain around should also be the most co@@ g@@ ni@@ tively able .
i &apos;ve been di@@ g@@ ging through the literature for the original reference for that number , and i could never find it .
it is just a large pri@@ mate brain .
and re@@ mar@@ k@@ ably , that mat@@ ches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago , when they invented cooking .
these were the low-@@ tech ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es to the high-@@ tech conversations i was having .
and i feel like i &apos;ve just got started .
but as soon as the fighting in@@ ten@@ si@@ fied , the physical re@@ h@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ tation was s@@ us@@ pen@@ ded .
behind him there was a child , his son , red in the face in an effort to push the father .
but ma@@ h@@ m@@ ou@@ d and his son were already there .
in the evening , i went to speak with the bo@@ s@@ ses at the head@@ quar@@ ters , and i told them -- i li@@ ed -- i told them , &quot; listen , we are going to start a couple of hours per day , just a few re@@ pa@@ ir@@ s . &quot;
two groups of mu@@ ja@@ hi@@ de@@ en started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what is that ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , t@@ al@@ l@@ er again .
physical ther@@ ap@@ ies can be done , not only in the or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c center , but also in the houses of the people .
and you should see me during the match .
and that hospital could have a@@ ff@@ or@@ ded f@@ l@@ as@@ h@@ lights .
why ? because the path i had taken was considered out of bo@@ un@@ ds .
but i learned something more profound than that , which is that the leaders -- the man@@ a@@ gers of ghana &apos;s economy -- were making bre@@ a@@ th@@ ta@@ k@@ ingly bad decisions that had brought our economy to the br@@ ink of collapse .
because i realized that the state of the african continent would matter to my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to bring the experience that i had at s@@ war@@ th@@ more to africa .
am i out of time ? ok .
we have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation .
you &apos;ll notice that it looks pretty much like the i@@ con@@ ic yellow ball -- that sun that we all draw when we &apos;re children .
as a matter of fact , this is something that about half of you , more than half of you will not be familiar with .
th@@ ir@@ t@@ y-@@ two t@@ ab@@ lets of cal@@ ms for@@ te .
good b@@ y@@ e . &quot;
and that &apos;s the kind of information they &apos;re going to bring back to you ?
because , the bottom line is , the s@@ po@@ n@@ s@@ ors love it , and he will ex@@ pos@@ e her to television pu@@ b@@ li@@ city all the time .
a professional p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ic who spe@@ a@@ ks to dead people , she can &apos;t reach me ?
what is hom@@ e@@ op@@ a@@ th@@ y ?
we really would love to have su@@ g@@ ge@@ sti@@ ons from you folks on how to contact federal , state and local au@@ th@@ ori@@ ties to get them to do something .
thank you .
so it runs fre@@ qu@@ ently , the entire hospital , just on a gener@@ ator .
there has to be something better . &quot;
but this gives control to the pro@@ vi@@ der , whether there &apos;s power or not , because they can ad@@ just the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they &apos;re giving their patient .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
the different types of writing in africa , first was pro@@ to-@@ writing , as il@@ lu@@ st@@ r@@ ated by n@@ si@@ bi@@ d@@ i , which is the writing system of a secret society of the e@@ ja@@ g@@ ha@@ m people in southern nigeria .
that is , until 19@@ 9@@ 8 , when one y@@ al@@ e professor john co@@ le@@ man dar@@ n@@ el@@ l discovered these in@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tions in the the@@ b@@ es desert on the li@@ me@@ stone cli@@ ff@@ s in western egypt , and these have been d@@ ated at between 18@@ 0@@ 0 and 19@@ 0@@ 0 b@@ .@@ c. , centuries before m@@ es@@ o@@ po@@ t@@ am@@ ia .
nearly one-@@ fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by li@@ ve@@ stock production -- more than transportation .
not bad .
i like animals , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s just fine to in@@ du@@ stri@@ alize their production and to ch@@ ur@@ n them out like they were w@@ r@@ en@@ ches .
and f@@ an@@ cy food was entirely french .
if we had a slide of sal@@ is@@ bur@@ y ste@@ ak , even more so , right ?
it wasn &apos;t all bad .
let me pos@@ e you a question .
some of us might think that would be a good thing .
about a year ago , i asked myself a question : &quot; knowing what i know , why am i not a ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ari@@ an ? &quot;
on the we@@ e@@ k@@ end , your choice .
so you can take a picture with an iphone and get all the names , although , again , sometimes it does make mistakes .
she kept getting di@@ stra@@ cted . he eventually won the race .
can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the sta@@ kes are so big , but it &apos;s a very ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted area .
or an a@@ es@@ the@@ tic experience -- a sun@@ set or a great piece of art .
human nature would have to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s the reason why we have ethical ground for pur@@ su@@ ing these -- is that they &apos;re also in@@ tr@@ in@@ si@@ cally valuable .
might be more complicated in humans , but perhaps not that much .
j@@ h : is there a re@@ li@@ e@@ f in playing with these forces ?
so that told me right away : i need a remote control device .
you &apos;ve got gravity , you &apos;ve got the c@@ ent@@ ri@@ fu@@ g@@ al force , you &apos;ve got the fluid dynamics .
so i think , con@@ c@@ ei@@ v@@ ably , those could be pre@@ di@@ ctive .
it &apos;s a ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ c studio as@@ si@@ st@@ ant .
so we take the pi@@ zz@@ a , our very first pi@@ zz@@ a , and we de@@ v@@ our sli@@ ce after sli@@ ce as the de@@ li@@ ver@@ y@@ man stands there and star@@ es at us from the do@@ or@@ way .
i was in my 20@@ s before i ever went to an art museum .
so i thought , okay , i have to have some cri@@ ter@@ i@@ a of how to choose work .
this isn &apos;t photo@@ sh@@ op@@ p@@ ed .
and they were interested in developing a new , alternative art space , and they needed funding for it , so they decided to come up with some interesting f@@ und@@ raising projects .
this project is called &quot; love ne@@ sts . &quot;
and so we got to the gra@@ ve and made this , which was h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous -- the attention that we got .
and also they reference how the u@@ v@@ ul@@ a -- everything they say is f@@ al@@ l@@ en because of the for@@ bi@@ d@@ den fruit .
he &apos;s an au@@ st@@ r@@ ali@@ an ab@@ original el@@ der , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it ties to origami . so let me start .
that is , people applied mathematical principles to the art , to discover the under@@ lying laws .
or you can ra@@ m@@ p up and go up to 50 stars on a fla@@ g , with 13 stri@@ p@@ es .
how would you make a single fla@@ p ?
so we figured out these rules wh@@ er@@ e@@ by you pack circles , you de@@ cor@@ ate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules . that gives you the f@@ ol@@ ds .
you can make multiple subjects .
but if you want to go higher and go larger than this , then you might need some origami .
and that works whether you &apos;re going into space , or whether you &apos;re just going into a body .
i grew up in a lo@@ g c@@ ab@@ in in washington state with too much time on my hands .
and we &apos;ve only got three minutes , but we could talk about it for hours .
and this is why i like to talk about this , because if we don &apos;t ac@@ knowledge it , then the transition will be pretty painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;ll see on this graph -- it begins in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , just before women start f@@ lo@@ o@@ ding the work@@ force , and it brings us up to our current day .
you would be is@@ su@@ ing or@@ ders from above .
because i &apos;m writing a book about all this , i &apos;m still looking into it , so i don &apos;t have the answer .
and this was very dis@@ he@@ ar@@ ten@@ ing for them .
now because we haven &apos;t fully pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ed this information , it &apos;s kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated ways , where you can see that the st@@ er@@ e@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es are changing .
there &apos;s no man or woman standing in the middle about to cut the c@@ ab@@ les .
whereas the personal income , on a scale that has been held constant to ac@@ com@@ mo@@ date for in@@ f@@ lation , has more than d@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed , almost tri@@ pl@@ ed , in that period .
and in order to hear me and understand what i &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 bits per second .
it happens also , actually , in the most recent book i wrote , called &quot; good business , &quot; where i inter@@ vi@@ e@@ wed some of the ce@@ os who had been n@@ om@@ in@@ ated by their pe@@ ers as being both very successful and very ethical , very soci@@ ally responsible .
control is also a good place to be , because there you feel comfortable , but not very excited .
means &quot; where were you born and raised and educated ? &quot;
because when my grand@@ parents were born , they pretty much had their sense of home , their sense of community , even their sense of en@@ m@@ ity , as@@ signed to them at birth , and didn &apos;t have much chance of ste@@ pping outside of that .
more and more of us are ro@@ ot@@ ed in the future or the present ten@@ se as much as in the past .
and i went down to the room in which i was to be sleeping .
p@@ ic@@ o i@@ yer : where is home ?
there was a big gap between the one billion in the in@@ du@@ stri@@ alized world and the two billion in the developing world .
but this is the world we have today , no longer any gap .
and let me show you why by conver@@ ting back to the ol@@ d-@@ time digital technology .
child survival is the new green .
and they were com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive about this : &quot; you po@@ m@@ mi@@ es , your rates of heart disease are sho@@ cking . &quot;
but if you give people vi@@ t@@ am@@ in d supp@@ le@@ ments , you don &apos;t change that high rate of heart disease .
and i first off started work in cell culture , growing cells , and then i was using k@@ no@@ ck@@ out mouse models -- mice that couldn &apos;t make the gene .
one of the subjects here was my mo@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law , and clearly i do not know her age .
in summer , you might as well be at the e@@ qu@@ ator .
certainly many ad@@ van@@ ces , many lives saved .
and this is actually real photography , ti@@ med photography , showing how that limb re@@ gener@@ ates in a period of days .
and then , six months later on the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side you see this re@@ en@@ g@@ ine@@ ered u@@ re@@ th@@ r@@ a .
a blood v@@ es@@ se@@ l is made up of two different cell types .
we place it back into this o@@ ven@@ -like device .
again , fairly more complex organs , but by far , the most complex solid organs are actually the v@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zed , highly v@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zed , a lot of blood v@@ es@@ se@@ l supply , organs such as the heart , the liver , the ki@@ d@@ ne@@ ys .
and that &apos;s actually what you &apos;re seeing .
and we prefer cells that will not re@@ je@@ ct and will not form tumors .
we are just taking five seconds .
every problem that &apos;s out there , somebody has the idea for .
it &apos;s probably why i &apos;m a little bit p@@ ani@@ cked right now -- other than all the ca@@ ff@@ e@@ in@@ e that i &apos;ve had and the sugar -- but this is really cre@@ e@@ p@@ y for an ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eu@@ r .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to go to an m@@ b@@ a program .
i sold license plate prote@@ ctors door to door .
it &apos;s like a re@@ c@@ es@@ sion . so , there &apos;s a re@@ c@@ es@@ sion .
and you &apos;d make these ch@@ a@@ ir@@ s .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense . &quot; you just figure out a way to make more money faster .
so i sold lots and lots of sun@@ glasses .
and then they don &apos;t have a regular check , but they have more opportunities to find more stuff , and they learn the skill of ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ating , and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well .
if you go into a restaurant and you have bad cu@@ st@@ om@@ er service , show them what bad cu@@ st@@ om@@ er service looks like .
these guys , gr@@ as@@ sh@@ op@@ per .
the pro@@ gr@@ es@@ sion of today &apos;s college student is to j@@ et@@ ti@@ son every interest except one .
ma@@ st@@ er@@ y of basic skills and a b@@ are min@@ im@@ um of cultural li@@ ter@@ ac@@ y el@@ u@@ des vast numbers of our students .
the value of the past also comes alive ; it provides a lot of company .
but it is a politics of principle , not of par@@ ti@@ s@@ an@@ s@@ hip .
you have a mind . and you have other people .
but the thing i want you to think about when we think about con@@ ser@@ va@@ ti@@ ves -- not so much this issue of the 19@@ 80 con@@ ven@@ tion -- the thing to think about is this : they go to church .
now , i know you don &apos;t believe me , really , here .
and it &apos;s not just that it y@@ i@@ el@@ ds a different kind of product at the end , it &apos;s that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other .
wil@@ dly different .
actually , it &apos;s not a ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ wing non@@ profit , but of course -- let me just tie it here -- the creative com@@ mon@@ s , which is o@@ ff@@ ering au@@ th@@ ors this simple way to mark their content with the fre@@ e@@ d@@ om@@ s they in@@ ten@@ ded to carry .
john mc@@ ca@@ in .
and i wonder how often that happens .
he told me that he &apos;d in@@ vi@@ te the test subject in , and he &apos;d say , &quot; you know , there &apos;s a s@@ na@@ ke in the next room and we &apos;re going to go in there . &quot;
so i thought one of the things i &apos;d do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like .
and the hospital and ge were happy too .
i sur@@ vi@@ ved , just so you know .
i get asked all of the time from people , &quot; is it possible to really design micro@@ bi@@ al ecosystems ? &quot;
another f@@ ac@@ et of how microbes get around is by people , and designers often c@@ lu@@ ster rooms together to f@@ ac@@ i@@ li@@ ta@@ te interactions among people , or the sharing of ideas , like in l@@ ab@@ s and in o@@ ff@@ ic@@ es .
imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want in a plane or on a phone .
and nobody knew anything about it .
and my company , o@@ w@@ l built a system called guide for the apple ma@@ c@@ in@@ to@@ s@@ h .
in 19@@ 9@@ 2 , his paper was re@@ je@@ cted for the hy@@ per@@ text conference .
they wanted to put an end to it . and one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these hum@@ p@@ back whales .
7@@ 8 percent of the v@@ ot@@ es , and to give you an idea of the land@@ slide , the next highest name pulled in three . okay ?
and that &apos;s the final message that i want to share with all of you -- that you can do well online .
so now , i suppose , i don &apos;t need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today .
this is the school , built with the community .
something we have in g@@ and@@ o are clay po@@ ts .
that is it .
good morning . so magic is an excellent way for sta@@ ying ahead of the reality curve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
there is the color red and the color black , re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ing the constant change from day to night .
voice : why not ? that &apos;s a very good hand .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ -@@ state , rather than a na@@ ti@@ on@@ -@@ state .
but you can &apos;t run a country like china , a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ -@@ state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
and the reason for this is , fi@@ r@@ st@@ ly , because the state in china is given a very special -- it en@@ jo@@ ys a very special si@@ g@@ ni@@ fi@@ can@@ ce as the re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative , the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment and the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of chinese civilization , of the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ -@@ state .
it went for 1,@@ 1@@ 14 miles , lin@@ king b@@ ei@@ j@@ ing with h@@ an@@ g@@ z@@ ho@@ u and sh@@ an@@ g@@ ha@@ i .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the g@@ 20 us@@ ur@@ ping very rapidly the position of the g@@ 7 , or the g@@ 8 .
it tra@@ v@@ el@@ s on ra@@ ils down a sub@@ urban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
red = d@@ ru@@ ms , blue = b@@ as@@ s , green = ch@@ or@@ ds , orange = leads , pur@@ p@@ le = pa@@ ds the m@@ ou@@ th@@ piece con@@ si@@ sts of ...
and the first song i wrote was in english , and the second one was in chinese .
she started singing her song .
i was doing gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i -- writing my name everywhere , using the city as a can@@ v@@ as .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all ac@@ ce@@ p@@ ted to be pa@@ sted next to the other .
&quot; you mean you &apos;re pa@@ sting an is@@ ra@@ el@@ i face -- doing a face -- right here ? &quot;
most of the places i went to , i decided to go there because i &apos;ve heard about it through the media .
i took more photos , and we started the project .
are you an n@@ go ? are you the media ? &quot;
when the ro@@ o@@ f@@ s were covered , a woman said as a joke , &quot; now god can see me . &quot;
because that &apos;s a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind each photo .
but they asked me for a promise basically .
or , &quot; how can we help ? &quot;
and as i think about the m@@ es@@ h and i think about , well , what &apos;s driving it , how come it &apos;s happening now , i think there &apos;s a number of ve@@ ctors that i want to give you as background .
they made it as@@ pi@@ rational .
z@@ i@@ p@@ car started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it &apos;s in@@ vi@@ ting par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion , and cities have , hi@@ st@@ or@@ ically , invited all sorts of par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion .
it &apos;s very co@@ st-@@ effective , and it &apos;s very m@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ y .
the last 40 years have been extraordinary times .
min@@ i@@ at@@ u@@ ri@@ zation as well .
this would im@@ p@@ ly a massive le@@ a@@ p in mi@@ gra@@ tion .
it is vital that the ideas that are n@@ ur@@ tu@@ red in ted , that the ideas that we think about look forward , and make sure that this will be the most gl@@ ori@@ ous century , and not one of e@@ co@@ -@@ disaster and e@@ co@@ -@@ collapse .
the rest of my family are boring ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ cs , busy collecting i@@ v@@ y le@@ a@@ gue de@@ c@@ als for our classic am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or car .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he was ko@@ o ko@@ o , but something about that really stuck .
and i sat like you guys there in the audience .
this is another painting .
but this brought me -- with ne@@ tr@@ a man@@ aging my career -- it brought me a lot of success .
i started exploring the dar@@ ker ab@@ sc@@ es@@ s@@ es of the human mind .
this time i said let &apos;s try something different .
so i said , okay .
s@@ w : much better . well , einstein is very h@@ on@@ or@@ ed to be here at ted 2006 , amongst all you mo@@ der@@ n-@@ day e@@ in@@ st@@ e@@ in@@ s . in fact , she &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you fell down .
s@@ w : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , remember ?
s@@ w : big finish .
s@@ w : what about a sk@@ un@@ k ?
my parents found it necessary for peace of mind .
if i have an art , it &apos;s de@@ con@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ting things that really sc@@ are the living hell out of me .
the body is den@@ s@@ er than water . 95 percent of it would be , at least , sub@@ mer@@ ged naturally .
and that will get you very far .
asked him what this said .
from that point , you can then , if you want to , ac@@ qui@@ re multiple languages , al@@ ter@@ na@@ te them so there is no inter@@ fer@@ ence .
and she looked up and said , &quot; now that &apos;s better . &quot;
so i think you &apos;ll agree , they look quite good together .
and have done experiments with about 50,000 students th@@ us far -- built , i &apos;d say , about a half dozen schools , my re@@ a@@ ders , at this point .
and what we found -- and we got quite a lot of things wrong and then im@@ pro@@ ved them -- but we found that the young people loved it .
ge@@ off mul@@ g@@ an : a short in@@ tr@@ o to the studio school
and finally the only person who will come forward is this young she@@ p@@ her@@ d boy , and he goes up to s@@ au@@ l and he says , &quot; i &apos;ll fight him . &quot;
there &apos;s ca@@ val@@ ry , men on h@@ or@@ se@@ back and with ch@@ ari@@ ots .
go@@ li@@ at@@ h is a sitting du@@ ck . he doesn &apos;t have a chance .
so go@@ li@@ at@@ h is head and sh@@ ou@@ l@@ ders above all of his pe@@ ers in that era , and usually when someone is that far out of the nor@@ m , there &apos;s an explanation for it .
and there is , i think , in that , a very important lesson for all of us .
and it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes , and those microbes actually do us good much of the time , rather than killing us .
c@@ le@@ an@@ ed out all the microbes , and then put it in the re@@ ci@@ pi@@ ent .
most of the p@@ il@@ l@@ s that you can take or the yo@@ g@@ ur@@ ts that you can eat have one or two species in them , maybe five species in them , and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species .
what we need is a full field guide to the microbes that live in and on people , so that we can understand what they &apos;re doing to our lives .
a lot of people think in a very en@@ g@@ li@@ sh@@ -@@ c@@ ent@@ ri@@ c way on the internet , but for us , we &apos;re truly global . we &apos;re in many , many languages .
so when you saw him make a ridiculous ed@@ it to the page about me , you think , oh , this is obviously just going to de@@ generate into ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk a lot about truth and ob@@ je@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty .
and we have over 40 ir@@ c chan@@ n@@ els , 40 ma@@ il@@ ing li@@ sts .
it &apos;s not a perfect rule , but it &apos;s a nice starting point for quick research .
and i also like to say she &apos;s the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , so ...
it stri@@ kes me that much of the te@@ x@@ t@@ books that are used to e@@ du@@ c@@ ate our children are in@@ her@@ ently bi@@ as@@ ed .
in the j@@ un@@ gl@@ es of gu@@ at@@ em@@ al@@ a , in ti@@ k@@ al , stands a te@@ m@@ p@@ le .
it was told by an an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ous k@@ wa@@ ki@@ u@@ t@@ l indian of southern al@@ as@@ ka to a mis@@ si@@ on@@ ary in 18@@ 9@@ 6 , and here it is .
it &apos;s way below your cognitive thinking process .
we found activity in other brain regions also -- in a brain region associated with cal@@ cul@@ ating ga@@ ins and lo@@ s@@ ses .
i &apos;ve got a gi@@ r@@ l@@ friend who &apos;s just getting over a terrible love a@@ ff@@ air .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we s@@ wi@@ v@@ el towards each other , we do what we call the &quot; an@@ ch@@ or@@ ing ga@@ ze &quot; and we talk .
and they would be s@@ om@@ e@@ things like sa@@ ws , k@@ ni@@ ves , si@@ ck@@ les and a@@ x@@ es that i covered up with a piece of to@@ we@@ l .
you see , i se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ed far and wide , but never bo@@ ther@@ ed to look close and near .
and in some parts of the world , they use tools , like s@@ po@@ n@@ ges to h@@ un@@ t fish .
so dolphins can bu@@ z@@ z and ti@@ ck@@ le each other at a distance .
you see , they &apos;re sy@@ n@@ ch@@ r@@ oni@@ zing with their partner as well as the other dy@@ ad .
but we quickly found out that dolphins simply were not going to hang around the boat using a ke@@ y@@ board .
now this dolphin , we call her &quot; the sc@@ ar@@ f th@@ i@@ e@@ f , &quot; because over the years she &apos;s ab@@ s@@ con@@ ded with about 12 sc@@ ar@@ ves .
but as we de@@ code their natural sounds , we &apos;re also planning to put those back into the com@@ pu@@ ter@@ i@@ zed system .
and it &apos;s a ma@@ de@@ -@@ up word .
there is y@@ ves ro@@ s@@ s@@ y .
and especially when you take a tracking position , you have the feeling that you are flying .
y@@ r : actually , i try to stay just fit .
i did use that during these last 15 years about 20 times -- never with that type of wing , but at the beginning .
let &apos;s not tell you em@@ p@@ lo@@ yer .
but it was too st@@ on@@ ey and full of c@@ ac@@ tu@@ s on top .
wondering , therefore , how to explain what they saw in terms of things un@@ seen .
because that event was the scientific revolution , ever since which our knowledge of the physical world , and of how to adapt it to our wi@@ sh@@ es , has been growing rel@@ ent@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ly .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
yours comes from gu@@ es@@ s@@ work , ours from the bible . &quot;
there is such a thing as a de@@ fe@@ ct in a story .
and it &apos;s only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it &apos;s te@@ st@@ able .
glasses are not very expensive . they &apos;re quite pl@@ en@@ ti@@ ful .
there are about 3@@ 0,000 in use now .
what was this place called min@@ to ?
so , the new fe@@ sti@@ val , it asks the audience to play an essential role in sha@@ ping the performance .
she had ga@@ ther@@ ed with others to watch &apos; the su@@ l@@ tan &apos;s elephant , &apos; and , you know , it just made all the difference . &quot;
well , no tr@@ un@@ cal at@@ a@@ x@@ i@@ a , that &apos;s go@@ o@@ d@@ .@@ first doctor : you feeling li@@ gh@@ t-@@ headed or di@@ zz@@ y at all ?
i thought , my career &apos;s over .
this was a bear i sat with for a while on the sh@@ or@@ es .
this is a piece of multi@@ -@@ year ice that &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you pictures of bel@@ u@@ g@@ a whales , bo@@ wh@@ e@@ ad whales , and nar@@ wh@@ als , and polar bears , and le@@ op@@ ard se@@ als today , but this picture right here means more to me than any other i &apos;ve ever made .
and people were like , &quot; we knew they were vi@@ ci@@ ous . we knew they were . &quot;
and this se@@ al is taking this pen@@ gu@@ in by the head , and it &apos;s fli@@ pping it back and forth .
she went off , she got a pen@@ gu@@ in .
she &apos;s trying to for@@ ce@@ -@@ feed my camera , which is every photographer &apos;s dream .
paul ni@@ ck@@ l@@ en : t@@ al@@ es of ic@@ e-@@ bo@@ un@@ d w@@ on@@ der@@ lands
now open your eyes .
do you have your ring as well ?
now this is a task for you to focus on .
joe , we &apos;re going to keep doing this till you catch it .
yeah , it &apos;s funny . we &apos;ve got a little guy . he &apos;s union . he works up there all day .
like i said , it shapes your reality .
and we worked together first with building and growing us@@ ha@@ hi@@ d@@ i .
it costs me five k@@ en@@ y@@ an sh@@ il@@ l@@ ings , or .@@ 0@@ 6 us@@ d to call the u.s. , canada or china .
it &apos;s built in a mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ar way so that you can also at@@ ta@@ ch a satellite mo@@ du@@ le so that you could have internet con@@ ne@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty even in very remote areas .
over time , the buildings got t@@ al@@ l@@ er and bigger , our engineering even better , so that the mechanical systems were massive . they require a huge amount of energy .
suppose that two american friends are traveling together in it@@ al@@ y .
please raise your hand if you &apos;d say you &apos;re li@@ ber@@ t@@ ari@@ an .
the best definition of in@@ n@@ at@@ en@@ ess i &apos;ve ever seen -- this just cl@@ ari@@ fi@@ es so many things for me -- is from the brain scientist g@@ ary mar@@ c@@ us .
we get to exercise some ancient , ancient drives .
but look at the other three lines .
aren &apos;t those just the fo@@ un@@ da@@ tions of x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ a and au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism and pu@@ ri@@ tan@@ ism ?
it sho@@ ots up and it keeps going up .
and they say , &quot; keep your laws off my body . &quot;
you have the mar@@ k@@ ings of shi@@ va on the right , shi@@ va &apos;s the liberal god . and they work together .
and so i think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all .
but if they respond , there &apos;s a range of other people around , who are in@@ no@@ cent people who might also get hurt -- be c@@ ol@@ l@@ at@@ er@@ al damage that the military often doesn &apos;t want to talk about .
we &apos;re looking at something different , &quot; and didn &apos;t seem to recognize , in fact , they were looking at pretty much the same stuff .
anyone want to take a sta@@ b at the number of times , given how they &apos;ve introduced this , the number of times police in qu@@ e@@ en@@ s@@ land used o@@ .@@ c. sp@@ ra@@ y in that period ?
there were , in fact , only a couple of people who got shot in this e@@ p@@ is@@ o@@ de .
so she &apos;s 7@@ 2 , and it &apos;s seen that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with her .
so if you th@@ re@@ at@@ en to use it , people are going to comp@@ ly with it , but it &apos;s also going to be something that doesn &apos;t leave any la@@ sting effects . &quot;
we have be@@ gun or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ zing makers at our maker fa@@ i@@ re .
b@@ il@@ l@@ y-@@ bo@@ b , or b@@ il@@ ly b@@ as@@ s , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he also moved here to meet other people doing what he &apos;s doing .
this is ma@@ k@@ er@@ bo@@ t .
and we &apos;ve got to get this into schools , or into communities in many , many ways -- the ability to tin@@ ker , to shape and res@@ ha@@ pe the world around us .
there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and actually , we see gl@@ am@@ ori@@ zed photos of stars all the time -- they call them false color .
she &apos;s not looking away from you exactly , but you have to m@@ ent@@ ally imagine her world .
sta@@ ir@@ cases that curve away from you are glamorous .
but there &apos;s always this illusion that if you buy this lam@@ p , you will live in a world without cor@@ ds .
the perfect love life -- sy@@ m@@ bo@@ li@@ zed by the perfect ne@@ ck@@ l@@ ac@@ e , the perfect di@@ am@@ on@@ d ring .
because glamour can be very t@@ ot@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ an and de@@ ce@@ p@@ tive .
but i also knew how hard they worked all week .
i did this in front of many st@@ r@@ an@@ gers .
i heard about women being mo@@ le@@ sted in their be@@ ds , flo@@ g@@ ged in their bur@@ q@@ as , left for dead in parking lots , ac@@ id bur@@ ned in their k@@ it@@ ch@@ ens .
then i got cancer -- or i found out i had cancer .
and my friend was pre@@ par@@ ing this big bo@@ w@@ l , and i said , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
it was ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ating friends and a d@@ ot@@ ing sister .
so il@@ l e@@ qui@@ pped are we all , to en@@ vision one another &apos;s inter@@ i@@ or work@@ ings and invisible a@@ im@@ s . &quot;
it takes children a long time to break into the system .
r@@ s : oh . so now jo@@ sh@@ u@@ a goes off to get a drink .
r@@ s : should i@@ van get in trouble for taking jo@@ sh@@ u@@ a &apos;s s@@ and@@ wi@@ ch ?
and she puts it in her friend &apos;s coffee .
first , i &apos;m going to show you that this is a magnetic p@@ ul@@ se .
please tell me that you &apos;re not taking phone calls from the p@@ ent@@ ag@@ on , say .
but why does anyone have to feel anything ?
and it was for , you gu@@ es@@ s@@ ed it , speed yo@@ g@@ a .
and the second is , is it possible , or even des@@ ir@@ able , to slow down ?
they want to get back to s@@ lo@@ w@@ er r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms .
and nor@@ way , sweden , den@@ mark and fin@@ land now r@@ an@@ k among the top six most com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive nations on earth , and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american we@@ ep with en@@ v@@ y .
but the new idea , the sort of re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary idea , of the slow movement , is that there is such a thing as &quot; good slow , &quot; too .
and i now find that be@@ d@@ time stories used to be a box on my to-@@ do list , something that i d@@ re@@ ad@@ ed , because it was so slow and i had to get through it quickly .
and so the process began and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t put it all on an island ; some of it has to be on the ma@@ in@@ land because we don &apos;t want to turn our back to the community . &quot;
i worked on it for months and i couldn &apos;t deal with it because i felt people were coming out of the historic museum , they are totally s@@ at@@ ur@@ ated with information and to see yet another museum with information , it would make them just un@@ able to di@@ g@@ es@@ t .
and then i went away for four months and there was going to be gro@@ und@@ breaking .
but one recognized the kind of uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess of the site .
mo@@ she sa@@ f@@ die : building uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess
so if ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an played a note -- like play an f@@ .
so ja@@ z@@ z , this b@@ and@@ stand is absolutely amazing .
it &apos;s not about bu@@ l@@ l@@ ying my vision or anything like that .
do i matter , or really exist for you ?
they went through a lot to get here .
and in the summer india he@@ ats up , gets very hot .
and then the adult , which comes after , lives for one or two months .
i didn &apos;t know at the time , but i know now , they &apos;re globe sk@@ im@@ m@@ ers , hundreds of them .
i got a little bit curious . in fact i &apos;ll stop here , because i want to ask , and there is a lot of people who , from india of course , people who grew up spending your childhood here .
so , next thing i did is i got on the phone .
october , no@@ v@@ em@@ ber , de@@ c@@ em@@ ber . that is not the nor@@ the@@ as@@ t mon@@ soon season .
okay , they lay their eggs where the se@@ as@@ on@@ al ra@@ ins are , the mon@@ soon ra@@ ins .
just last week the ra@@ ins broke . the short ra@@ ins broke and it &apos;s ra@@ in@@ ing there now .
a quite incredible fe@@ at .
incredible . this is the most extraordinary mi@@ gra@@ tion of any bird of pre@@ y . a quite incredible mi@@ gra@@ tion .
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with my life .
and everyone thought i was good . but in this new ter@@ rain , i was horrible . so people would go , &quot; oh , he &apos;s all -- oh , what happened to mul@@ l@@ en ? &quot;
and so the night before my surgery , i &apos;d watched , and i was like , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;
so , next — oh , mind you . those are the community .
so i &apos;ve had some success . and in the end , when you &apos;ve had all of these things , what is it that continues to drive you ? as i mentioned , the knee stuff and these things , what is it that will pun@@ ch you ?
i last did a te@@ d@@ talk i think about seven years ago or so .
but car@@ l nor@@ den is really the one who cra@@ cks the code .
and whenever the nor@@ den b@@ om@@ b@@ sight is taken onto a plane , it &apos;s es@@ cor@@ ted there by a series of ar@@ med gu@@ ar@@ ds .
and the chemical plant com@@ pris@@ ed 7@@ 5@@ 7 ac@@ r@@ es .
and after the war was over , there was an au@@ d@@ it done -- as the army always does , the air force always does -- and they asked the question : how many sc@@ u@@ ds did we actually destroy ?
i &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success story .
you walk down the street in any big city , you travel like that , and you are a@@ ma@@ zed at the diversity in the human species .
what we &apos;re asking about though is human an@@ ce@@ st@@ r@@ y .
but based on what data ?
and imagine c@@ op@@ ying that by hand .
this was an african man who gave rise to all the y ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some diversity around the world .
the sa@@ har@@ a was much bigger then than it is now .
people who would have speci@@ alized in killing the animals , h@@ un@@ ting the animals on those meat lo@@ cker sa@@ van@@ na@@ h@@ s , moving up , following the gr@@ as@@ s@@ lands into the middle east around 4@@ 5,000 years ago , during one of the rare we@@ t ph@@ ases in the sa@@ har@@ a .
the human genome project , or a mars ro@@ ver mission .
and we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from m@@ us@@ h to complexity .
so let &apos;s do it .
what you see here , the blue areas are about a th@@ ou@@ s@@ and@@ th of a degree co@@ ol@@ er than the red areas .
that op@@ er@@ ates over smaller scales than gravity , which explains why you and i are smaller than stars or planets .
you &apos;ll be familiar with the double he@@ li@@ x of dna .
let me explain why .
and in the last 200 years , something else has happened .
now you might ask , what is behavioral finance ?
we &apos;re not doing that well when it comes to insurance .
and then they have to decide how they &apos;re going to invest in their 5@@ 2 choices , and they never heard about what is a money market fund .
well that &apos;s at least what one wonderful study pre@@ di@@ cted .
but when you get your driving license , you check the box if you do not want to don@@ ate your organ .
the other group gets two ap@@ pl@@ es , one is taken away .
save more tomorrow makes it easy .
this is just one example .
this is a song about a creature called a hum@@ m@@ ing@@ bird m@@ ot@@ h which im@@ it@@ ates another creature which im@@ it@@ ates yet another creature .
hello . who &apos;s there , please ?
thank you all .
knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom .
i &apos;m trying to buy time .
so what did i do ?
we create stories to define our existence .
and what they did was , they sent wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ g@@ h down to physically separate her mor@@ t@@ al self from her spirit self .
are you with child ?
e@@ li@@ z@@ ab@@ e@@ th : get out ! get out ! get out !
i went to see a friend of mine , and he made me wait in his apartment in mal@@ ab@@ ar hill on the t@@ w@@ en@@ ti@@ e@@ th floor , which is a really , really up@@ market area in mu@@ m@@ ba@@ i .
everything &apos;s a con@@ tra@@ di@@ ction .
we lived on less than a dollar a day for about 15 years .
and you &apos;ve got to use nu@@ ts from the ra@@ in@@ forests to show that forests are worth more as forests than they are as pa@@ st@@ ure . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t wake a person who &apos;s pre@@ ten@@ ding to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about li@@ fe@@ st@@ y@@ les .
if they should all be sustainable on a fin@@ i@@ te planet , how do you make that happen ?
we need co@@ ke to work with pe@@ p@@ s@@ i .
this is nine of them .
we eventually got , i think , 60 percent of global production at the table and 25 percent of demand at the table .
that &apos;s not in@@ significant .
but they &apos;re not just buying the ju@@ ice ; they &apos;re also buying the carbon in the trees to o@@ ff@@ set the shi@@ p@@ ment costs associated with carbon to get the product into europe .
they completely inter@@ ru@@ p@@ t the communication between the brain and the spinal cor@@ d , th@@ us leading to complete and permanent par@@ al@@ y@@ sis of the leg .
it took many years , but eventually we developed an electro@@ chemical neuro@@ pro@@ s@@ th@@ es@@ is that transformed the neural network in the spinal cor@@ d from dor@@ m@@ ant to a highly functional state .
it took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal .
after a few weeks of recovery , we will im@@ plant a pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ able pump to deliver a per@@ son@@ alized ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cal co@@ ck@@ tail directly to the spinal cor@@ d .
and i was the product of a work@@ ing-@@ class community .
he talked about &quot; the world as it is &quot; and &quot; the world as it should be . &quot;
and having done so , these women moved many ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les .
in the white house , there &apos;s the desk that he si@@ ts at -- it &apos;s called the res@@ ol@@ ute desk .
on my last day , the woman who looked after the place , she came and we spoke for a minute , and then she said to me , &quot; would you sing something for me ? &quot;
to me , this piece is an o@@ de to the voice because it &apos;s my@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ ous -- as we can see -- it &apos;s quite s@@ po@@ n@@ tan@@ e@@ ous , and it &apos;s pri@@ ma@@ l .
they had none of that .
so the internet needs ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing and directions .
one of the most popular we@@ b@@ sites in the world , run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that youtube or google were particularly pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged to do about it .
and today , wikipedia is so u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous that you can now find it on chinese restaurant men@@ us .
and wikipedia has em@@ bra@@ ced this .
so this is a blog de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed to un@@ fortunate por@@ tra@@ it@@ ure .
why ? there is the cra@@ ig@@ sli@@ st ri@@ des@@ h@@ are board .
and the world didn &apos;t stop in the 1990s .
and we see that in some countries , the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very , very strong .
all that costs money .
a lot was done to increase the life chan@@ ces of students with an im@@ mi@@ gr@@ ant background or from social dis@@ advantage .
how do the media talk about schools and teachers ?
in bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic school systems , teachers are often left alone in c@@ l@@ as@@ s@@ rooms with a lot of pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion on what they should be teaching .
you know , some people argue that changing educational ad@@ min@@ i@@ stra@@ tion is like moving gra@@ ve@@ y@@ ar@@ ds .
but if you look , if you have that perspective , then you can see what happened in the last 60 years .
and i walked 10 miles or so , all morning , to get there , to the medicine man .
so obviously this was a g@@ ad@@ get to have .
so we could do that for tele@@ phones .
and it &apos;s a business for her .
&quot; the government needs to provide e@@ con@@ om@@ ically vi@@ able services . &quot;
once upon a time , at the age of 24 , i was a student at st@@ . john &apos;s medical college in b@@ an@@ g@@ al@@ ore .
and you can see my map if i get it up here . you know ?
and i also bring an innovation here .
in the 19@@ 30 &apos;s now , you can see that japan is going to a period of war , with lower life ex@@ pe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy .
and they decided to go not only for health and education , but also starting to grow their economy .
washington , d@@ .@@ c. went out here .
the bu@@ b@@ bles , not my bu@@ b@@ bles , but the financial bu@@ b@@ bles .
will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy , and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years , back to asia ?
the rest of the p@@ ie is a very my@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ ous sub@@ st@@ an@@ ce called dark energy .
but that cannot account for the mass either .
now , take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe , ok , a three-dimensional space .
and again , this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gra@@ vi@@ ta@@ tional len@@ sing .
they &apos;re moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger , ok .
so by looking at things like c@@ lu@@ sters of galaxies , and how they -- their number density , how many there are as a function of time -- we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy com@@ pe@@ te against each other in structure forming .
the big questions facing physics .
sle@@ e@@ p@@ y man ban@@ j@@ o boys : b@@ lu@@ e@@ grass vi@@ r@@ tu@@ o@@ si@@ ty from ... new j@@ er@@ se@@ y ?

and in fact among gay men in the us we did see that kind of change in the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s .
it &apos;s a disease that k@@ il@@ l@@ s a lot of adults in africa , in addition to a lot of children .
in uganda we see the pre@@ val@@ ence went down .
that suggests it &apos;s pretty similar levels of development .
but openness and inter@@ -@@ con@@ ne@@ c@@ te@@ dness , it comes with a cost when we think about disease . i don &apos;t think this should be a surprise .
coffee is uganda &apos;s major ex@@ por@@ t .
e@@ mi@@ ly o@@ ster re-@@ ex@@ am@@ ines the stat@@ s on aids in africa from an economic perspective and re@@ ach@@ es a st@@ un@@ ning conclusion : everything we know about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but it was fascinating to me , because i was looking at this sort of fine it@@ ali@@ an end papers .
it was called the bul@@ let train because it was ro@@ und@@ ed in front , but every time it went into a t@@ un@@ ne@@ l it would build up a pressure wave , and then it would create like a son@@ ic bo@@ om when it ex@@ ited .
and those bu@@ m@@ p@@ s act like a ma@@ g@@ net for water .
and then we wonder why the me@@ m@@ br@@ an@@ e clo@@ gs and why it takes so much electricity .

&quot; well , why ? &quot;
we were four of us , not one , and fortunately no boys .
you can &apos;t do a thing about it .
it &apos;ll never happen again in india , because now it was once and forever .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; all right , let &apos;s pra@@ y . &quot;
this was a medi@@ tation program inside the prison of over 1,000 pris@@ on@@ ers .
secondly is about the anti-@@ corruption movement in india .
let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a .
basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
and in fact , the number of sites that are using re@@ cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing per day is really , really large .
some of them are f@@ un@@ ni@@ er .
so right now the web is par@@ ti@@ ti@@ on@@ ed into multiple languages .
then comes my favorite part of the question .
there &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
but perhaps more sur@@ pris@@ ingly , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ers , the trans@@ la@@ tions that we get are as accurate as those of professional language trans@@ lat@@ ors , which is very surprising .
since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
the in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated side , the company , is doing things that it does really well .
building these pl@@ at@@ forms for par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion are so non@@ tri@@ vi@@ al to do .
and z@@ i@@ p@@ car provides a very nice , consistent service that works f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ously .
ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le called happiness &quot; the chief good , &quot; the end towards which all other things a@@ im .
maybe these people are right . maybe min@@ d-@@ w@@ an@@ der@@ ing is a bad thing .
ten percent of the time people &apos;s minds are w@@ an@@ der@@ ing when they &apos;re having sex .
i was playing the violent african , the african ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist .
now the first round of the v@@ ot@@ ing didn &apos;t bring forth a clear w@@ inner -- so nobody had achieved the absolute majority -- so v@@ ot@@ ing went into a second round three weeks later .
now here &apos;s an interesting com@@ par@@ is@@ on .
and i moved down to la j@@ ol@@ l@@ a and learned how to sur@@ f .
and people in the 17@@ th century , they didn &apos;t really understand the same way we do about you know , this stuff is a bunch of different kinds of molecules , and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that .
and so , charles said , i &apos;m going to put up the money give you guys a building , come here and you can meet in the building , but just don &apos;t talk about religion in there .
i mean , reality is what you can see .
i thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way .
just to see what would happen , if you mixed it together .
so , so i &apos;ve got something else that &apos;s not personal .
you want to be rich , you be a b@@ us@@ in@@ es@@ s@@ man .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it isn &apos;t going up -- it &apos;s not going up at all . we &apos;ve doing it very carefully now for 20 years , from s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ tes , and it isn &apos;t going up .
bio@@ ch@@ em@@ ist k@@ ary mul@@ li@@ s talks about the basis of modern science : the experiment . sharing t@@ al@@ es from the 17@@ th century and from his own back@@ y@@ ar@@ d-@@ ro@@ ck@@ et@@ ry days , mul@@ li@@ s c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ates the curiosity , inspiration and ri@@ g@@ or of good science in all its forms .
i wanted a simple way to represent a living body in@@ h@@ ab@@ it@@ ing these de@@ ca@@ ying , der@@ e@@ li@@ ct spaces .
&quot; naked city &quot; is a ni@@ ck@@ name for new york , and &quot; sp@@ le@@ en &quot; em@@ bodies the m@@ el@@ an@@ ch@@ o@@ li@@ a and in@@ er@@ ti@@ a that come from feeling ali@@ en@@ ated in an urban environment .
i love to travel , and ber@@ li@@ n has become one of my favorite cities .
and all this time , i never saw a single r@@ at in any of these places , until recently , when i was in the london se@@ w@@ er@@ s .
so the first question , and you might want to write this down , either on a bit of paper , physically , or a virtual piece of paper in your head . and , for vi@@ e@@ w@@ er@@ s at home , you can try this as well .
and we inter@@ cut it with , &quot; we are the pre@@ mi@@ er science university in the world , &quot; because of bri@@ ti@@ sh@@ -like hu@@ br@@ is .
except , in your -- you &apos;re no@@ d@@ ding -- now , in your el@@ li@@ p@@ se , have you thought , &quot; well , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and it &apos;s one of the difficult things is that when people have pre@@ con@@ ce@@ p@@ tions of how it all works , it &apos;s quite difficult to shift those .
and as an in@@ organic ch@@ em@@ ist , my friends and colleagues make this di@@ st@@ in@@ ction between the organic , living world and the in@@ organic , dead world .
and you can see , it &apos;s kind of po@@ l@@ l@@ in@@ ating , ger@@ min@@ ating , growing .
in fact , we have such amazing li@@ fe@@ forms that we can man@@ i@@ pu@@ late .
and darwin himself m@@ us@@ ed in a letter to a col@@ le@@ a@@ gue that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little po@@ n@@ d somewhere -- maybe not in sc@@ ot@@ land , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can ag@@ gre@@ gate them together and make literally thousands and thousands of really big n@@ an@@ o-@@ molecular molecules the same size of dna and proteins , but there &apos;s no carbon in sight .
we want to put it out in the environment , and we want it to be powered by the sun .
and i think , if we can make in@@ organic biology , and we can make matter become e@@ v@@ ol@@ vable , that will in fact define life .
there &apos;s a second reason i like these development goals , and that is because each and every one is measured .
and this is highly professional female inter@@ vi@@ e@@ w@@ er@@ s who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about &#91; her &#93; birth history .
i was actually , on fri@@ day , sitting in front of my computer , and i saw the death rate fall from 1@@ 2@@ 8 to 8@@ 4 just that morning .
you know , these economists , they love money , they want more and more of it , they want it to grow .
you can see it doesn &apos;t make sense to make an average of this zero im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ent and this very fast im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ent .
but you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
they had high , or very high , child mortality and family size , six to eight .
they have here q@@ at@@ ar .
the big resi@@ du@@ al is always value for money .
yes , i went bar@@ e@@ foot until i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; question the un@@ qu@@ e@@ sti@@ on@@ able .
all the time , you have been given an en@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ e .
and g@@ and@@ hi@@ an engineering , in my ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment , is the one which is going to take the world forward , is going to make a difference , not just for a few , but for everyone .
... above the limb , yes , it would be difficult ...
time for development -- it took around 10 years and 7@@ 0@@ 0 million dollars .
he had said , &quot; earth provides enough to sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fy every man &apos;s need , but not every man &apos;s gre@@ ed . &quot;
and in@@ f@@ an@@ ts die .
it was &#91; unclear &#93; high school .
when i was at council of scientific industry research -- 40 l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies -- when two l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or@@ ies were not talking to each other , i would &#91; unclear &#93; .
they agreed , and now i have app@@ s on the app store .
it &apos;s about per@@ fe@@ cting something old , and bringing something old into the 21st century .
it &apos;s still ther@@ m@@ ally hot but it &apos;s not radi@@ o@@ active .
so the core of this re@@ actor , since it &apos;s not under pressure and it doesn &apos;t have this chemical re@@ activity , means that there &apos;s no in@@ c@@ lin@@ ation for the f@@ is@@ sion products to leave this re@@ actor .
i think that i &apos;ve designed this re@@ actor here that can be an innovative source of energy , provide power for all kinds of ne@@ at scientific applications , and i &apos;m really prepared to do this .
so we &apos;re shi@@ f@@ ting to an experience economy , where experiences are becoming the pre@@ d@@ om@@ in@@ ant economic o@@ ff@@ ering .
there &apos;s a company that provides a cell phone service you have in case you get lost in the wo@@ o@@ ds .
at the end of a la@@ un@@ dry list of advice he &apos;s giving to his son , la@@ er@@ tes , he says this : and this above all : to th@@ in@@ e own self be true .
right ? you don &apos;t tend to walk a lot in los angeles , well , here &apos;s a place where you are going to walk a lot , outside in this city .
that &apos;s when you &apos;re per@@ c@@ ei@@ ved as fake , as a ph@@ on@@ y company -- ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ zing things that you &apos;re not .
when i was a very young child , i was extremely in@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted and very much to myself .
and then it was a matter of starting from one point and sort of building to that final point .
so i &apos;ve invented it in concrete , because it doesn &apos;t really matter .
and that was that tool .
and to me , that &apos;s the most important thing because , ever since being a kid , i &apos;ve wanted to communicate my passion and love .
25 days : heart ch@@ am@@ ber developing 32 days : arms &amp; amp ; hands are developing 3@@ 6 days : beginning of the pri@@ mi@@ tive ver@@ t@@ ab@@ ra@@ e these weeks are the period of the most ra@@ p@@ id development of the f@@ et@@ us .
the complexity of building that within a single system is , again , beyond any com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sion or any existing mathematics today .
because apparently you can &apos;t have this fra@@ gi@@ le is@@ ot@@ op@@ e of li@@ th@@ i@@ um@@ -@@ 6 in the at@@ mo@@ sp@@ her@@ es of sun@@ -like stars .
now , what we can do with the spe@@ c@@ tr@@ a ?
the other day , my col@@ le@@ a@@ gue from ber@@ k@@ el@@ e@@ y , gi@@ b@@ or bas@@ r@@ i , e@@ ma@@ iled me a very interesting spectrum , asking me , &quot; can you have a look at this ? &quot;
you have two chan@@ n@@ els -- the massive stars and low-@@ mass stars -- producing and re@@ cy@@ cl@@ ing matter and chemical elements in the universe .
because can you imagine everything bo@@ il@@ ing ?
now imagine an object , amazing object , or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say , &quot; look , we give up . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see the ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en dioxide and oxygen , i think we have the perfect e@@ .@@ t@@ .
i was like , &quot; really ? &quot; and he was like , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
the things i can tell you about it : it &apos;s universal ; we all have it .
i have a s@@ light office supply ad@@ di@@ ction , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a little bre@@ a@@ k@@ down -- -- which actually looked more like this .
and i said , &quot; but here &apos;s the thing : no family stuff , no childhood sh@@ it . &quot;
what makes you feel vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you &apos;re wrong . shut up .
we pre@@ tend that what we do doesn &apos;t have an effect on people .
people were tracking their food via twitter , their kids &apos; di@@ a@@ pers on their iphone .
so that when we think about using them to get some sy@@ ste@@ matic im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ent , we also think about how they can be useful for self-@@ im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ent , for self-@@ discovery , self-@@ awareness , self-@@ knowledge .
and i want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do , which was to think about a new way of ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing healthcare .
so , ste@@ v@@ en is sharing this story , but he is not alone .
these are why people pra@@ y .
i love here -- the cy@@ ber@@ k@@ in@@ e@@ tics im@@ plant , which was , again , the only patient &apos;s data that was online and available .
and here &apos;s another paper .
you don &apos;t have the b@@ lin@@ ding , you don &apos;t have data , it doesn &apos;t follow the scientific method .
it &apos;s the in@@ t@@ ent to treat curve .
but my brother didn &apos;t . my brother went straight down the line .
if we walk into the b@@ 15 ic@@ e@@ berg when we leave here today , we &apos;re going to bu@@ m@@ p into something a thousand feet tall , 7@@ 6 miles long , 17 miles wide , and it &apos;s going to w@@ ei@@ g@@ h two gi@@ g@@ at@@ ons .
to change its state , by the way , takes two v@@ ol@@ ts from a m@@ il@@ li@@ second p@@ ul@@ se .
we said , &quot; could you build this ? &quot;
we can do better than this .
but there &apos;s an in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity .
as a result , networks are ideal re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ations of complex systems .
and it has implications for sy@@ ste@@ mic risk .
this allowed us to as@@ sign a degree of influence to each sh@@ ar@@ e@@ h@@ ol@@ der .
we &apos;re seeing the em@@ er@@ gen@@ ce of long-term and hi@@ g@@ h@@ l@@ y-@@ funded programs which a@@ im at understanding our ne@@ t@@ worked world from a complexity point of view .
in water pi@@ p@@ es , we have fi@@ x@@ e@@ d-@@ capacity water pi@@ p@@ es that have fixed flow rates , except for expensive pu@@ m@@ p@@ s and val@@ ves .
and we built 500 of these glass be@@ a@@ k@@ ers .
so no human interaction .
so we were up on top of our b@@ un@@ k be@@ ds .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean anything ; it &apos;s fake data .
and very quickly , my brain starts to think that &apos;s the accurate ra@@ ti@@ o of negative to positive in the world .
because what that question as@@ su@@ m@@ es is that our ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world is pre@@ di@@ ctive of our happiness levels , when in reality , if i know everything about your ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al world , i can only predict 10 percent of your long-term happiness .
and the problem is it &apos;s s@@ ci@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ cally broken and backwards for two reasons .
we get people , when they open up their in@@ box , to write one positive email pra@@ is@@ ing or th@@ an@@ king somebody in their social support network .
i can &apos;t tell you -- family business story : you &apos;d understand this -- my father was the most sin@@ c@@ er@@ e man possible .
so i kind of s@@ wi@@ t@@ ched . i went to mit , finished .
they were saying , make it stop now .
they &apos;re picking up a giant flo@@ p@@ p@@ y dis@@ k made of car@@ d@@ board .
he was the first digital media pro@@ du@@ c@@ er in to@@ k@@ y@@ o .
do you hear that ? it &apos;s like co@@ ws . this is at 4 a@@ .@@ m@@ . at lo@@ g@@ an .
so an@@ y@@ ways , there are all these things you can do , but the thing i love the most is to experience , taste the world .
and i went after it with passion .
their culture isn &apos;t working in schools , and i &apos;m going to share with you ways that we can think about over@@ coming that problem .
this makes university ad@@ min@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ ators very nervous , because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools that don &apos;t have boys .
and little moments in my life .
are there m@@ om@@ s who &apos;ve raised boys around that table ?
we need to change the min@@ d@@ set of ac@@ ce@@ p@@ t@@ ance in boys in el@@ em@@ ent@@ ary schools .
and they say these things as if it &apos;s okay .
let &apos;s see where this hy@@ po@@ th@@ es@@ is is going to lead us .
is this a problem ? yes , it &apos;s a big a problem .
we think that this these &quot; why &quot; questions can give us c@@ lu@@ es about the fundamental principles of nature .
and i &apos;m going to try and show that at the end , and the s@@ us@@ pen@@ se will be as much mine if it works .
and that &apos;s kind of been a big lesson to me , that you can &apos;t act on any object .
so for example , we &apos;ve created a newspaper , a regular newspaper .
so it &apos;s wi@@ r@@ el@@ es@@ s@@ ly linked to my i@@ pa@@ d , and this is a software that &apos;s running on the i@@ pa@@ d .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add an interaction system . so what i did was , i added a pro@@ x@@ im@@ ity sen@@ s@@ or , so that when you get close to the people in j@@ ars , they react to you in different ways .
from my current self , i &apos;m turned into a mi@@ d@@ d@@ le-@@ a@@ ged man , and then , from there , into an el@@ der@@ ly man .
within the light sport aircraft cat@@ e@@ g@@ ory .
radio : what did you think of that ?
just fold up the w@@ ings and keep going .
so i &apos;ll ask you another question .
and he pl@@ an@@ ted it in a ro@@ y@@ al po@@ ta@@ to pat@@ ch , with gu@@ ar@@ ds who had in@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tions to gu@@ ard over it , night and day , but with secret in@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ tions not to gu@@ ard it very well .
because they found that loss a@@ version is a more powerful influence on people &apos;s behavior .
however , what we do have now is a much more v@@ ar@@ i@@ e@@ g@@ ated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value , and it &apos;s much fa@@ ir@@ er .
now , if we have all these tools at our dis@@ pos@@ al , we simply have to ask the question , and th@@ al@@ er and sun@@ st@@ ei@@ n have , of how we can use these more in@@ t@@ el@@ li@@ g@@ ently .
so they are in@@ tro@@ du@@ cing new di@@ am@@ on@@ d sh@@ re@@ d@@ dies .
they give b@@ ad@@ ge value to everyday little tri@@ vi@@ al activities .
i felt my passion , heart and soul , had left my body .
audience : no .
s@@ b : no , not without .
all around us , still cl@@ um@@ si@@ ly dri@@ f@@ ting about in its pri@@ me@@ val s@@ ou@@ p of culture , is another re@@ p@@ li@@ cat@@ or .
you probably went out and bought them .
imagine a world full of brains and far more me@@ m@@ es than can possibly find homes .
we alone are gene machines and me@@ me machines as well .
i think that &apos;s the wrong way to think about it .
that was dangerous , all right .
they are using us to su@@ ck up the planet &apos;s resources to produce more computers , and more of all these amazing things we &apos;re hearing about here at ted .
and will we get through this third danger point , like we got through the second and like we got through the first ?
working with min@@ u@@ sta@@ h , which is the u.n. mission in haiti , with the min@@ i@@ st@@ r@@ y of public works , with different n@@ go@@ s , we in@@ spe@@ cted over 1,@@ 500 buildings .
it won &apos;t cost us any more to do it the right way . &quot;
and because i had 70 percent of my body bur@@ ned , it would take about an hour .
and it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of re@@ cu@@ per@@ ate from the pain .
and how much pun@@ is@@ h@@ ment would i get if i get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the more religious people -- the people who re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed more of the com@@ m@@ and@@ ments -- che@@ ated less , and the less religious people -- the people who couldn &apos;t remember almost any com@@ m@@ and@@ ments -- che@@ ated more .
would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by to@@ ken make a difference ?
here is the thing .
i think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market .
but trust me , i work in advertising .
these are the more po@@ li@@ te ones i could share with you today .
and suddenly you &apos;re getting amazon , as a brand , is going head to head with the federal res@@ er@@ ve in terms of how you want to spend your money , what money is , what con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tes money .
and you think , is it much of a le@@ a@@ p ?
now i &apos;m sure as everyone in the audience already knows -- i did have to explain it to my n@@ in@@ e-@@ year-old late last week -- pen@@ is@@ es are structures that trans@@ f@@ er sp@@ er@@ m from one individual to another .
and i already knew that animals like this ear@@ th@@ wor@@ m , indeed most animals , don &apos;t support their ti@@ s@@ su@@ es by dra@@ ping them over bones .
and that was because every hydro@@ static skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements .
everyone i showed it was really surprised at this .
a happy song about global warming , from j@@ il@@ l so@@ bu@@ le .
well i guess i have to now .
all right , okay .
will we play a t@@ un@@ e ?
self-@@ study , self-@@ exploration , self-@@ em@@ po@@ w@@ er@@ ment : these are the vi@@ r@@ tu@@ es of a great education .
the min@@ e@@ cra@@ ft community went ban@@ an@@ as over this project , and ben became an in@@ st@@ ant media c@@ el@@ e@@ bri@@ ty .
moving along , what about the area of this figure ?
i was forced to leave the democratic re@@ public of the congo , my home , where i was a student ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ist .
but re@@ mar@@ k@@ ably , the u.n. environmental pro@@ gra@@ m@@ me has e@@ sti@@ ma@@ ted the wealth of the country to be over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not there yet .
they &apos;d have to be available at very com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive rates .
but is there more that could be done for this corner of the labor market ?
they asked governments for su@@ p@@ por@@ ting re@@ g@@ ul@@ atory re@@ gi@@ m@@ es , and in a lot of cases they got it .
but let &apos;s suppose that our a@@ im is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid .
because they would have to get a lot of these small trans@@ actions going to start making their return .
he liked to sit on her la@@ p because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed .
we &apos;ve known about fu@@ sion since 19@@ 20 , when sir ar@@ th@@ u@@ r st@@ an@@ ley e@@ d@@ d@@ ing@@ ton and the british as@@ soci@@ ation for the ad@@ van@@ c@@ em@@ ent of science con@@ je@@ c@@ tu@@ red that that &apos;s why the sun sh@@ ines .
okay . what is fu@@ sion ? here comes the nuclear physics .
and that energy is what powers fu@@ sion .
and we get within about the same price as current electricity .
we have to get to a power plant .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country and it &apos;s also one with a great deal of influence .
while as@@ p@@ ir@@ ing to democracy the most , they were the least likely population in the world to say that they had actually vo@@ ic@@ ed their opinion to a public official in the last month -- at only four percent .
but people &apos;s ex@@ pe@@ c@@ tations for their future went up si@@ g@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant@@ ly .
so the question becomes , what drives men &apos;s support for women &apos;s rights ?
i promise she read that text .
no one he@@ ars you in a st@@ all , you &apos;re just te@@ x@@ ting qui@@ et@@ ly .
you could see the im@@ medi@@ ate impact of le@@ g@@ is@@ lation or a hat@@ e@@ ful speech that somebody gives in a school as@@ se@@ m@@ bly and see what happens as a result .
the flight la@@ sted 12 seconds and covered 1@@ 20 feet .
that &apos;s an un@@ natural act for a rocket .
it w@@ ei@@ gh@@ s less than one a@@ a battery .
from the s@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ est wi@@ s@@ p of air to the powerful forces of nature &apos;s st@@ or@@ ms .
it allows us to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te and to be heard as individuals .
we think someone else , someone s@@ mar@@ ter than us , someone more capable , someone with more resources will solve that problem .
we didn &apos;t fly it into the pacific .
it took them 10 full pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es to get something that would actually fly .
and so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what &apos;s possible and this tremendous s@@ er@@ i@@ ou@@ s@@ ness of what it means .
let &apos;s think about your ethical footprint .
and the war@@ den was quite am@@ used , and he told me he thought that i was a nu@@ t and he told me , &quot; this place is a cor@@ re@@ ction facility . these guys are serious o@@ ff@@ en@@ ders .
it took me several such in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents to figure out what i was supposed to do .
when i started this program four years ago , i had this original plan of creating a team of winning under@@ dogs .
and you look down at yo@@ k@@ ne@@ am ; everything is so small and tiny .
and i feel bl@@ es@@ s@@ ed and fortunate that 15 years ago i had the courage to res@@ ig@@ n my ten@@ u@@ red position at n@@ y@@ u and return to my home country where i can do these incredible ri@@ des with this group of tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed kids coming from ethiopia and mor@@ oc@@ co and russia .
and how many times would my self have to die before i realized that it was never alive in the first place ?
and i was a really good dan@@ c@@ er .
st@@ r@@ an@@ g@@ el@@ y , these re@@ v@@ el@@ ations didn &apos;t cure my low self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em , that feeling of o@@ th@@ er@@ n@@ ess .
it &apos;s because i didn &apos;t have a self to get in the way .
imagine what kind of existence we can have if we honor ine@@ vi@@ table death of self , appreciate the privilege of life and mar@@ v@@ el at what comes next .
and this is a c@@ af@@ e by the sea in britain .
but instead of what it is , our focus was on the way it worked .
and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a co@@ st-@@ effective way of making a structure to do this .
but we realized that seeds -- there &apos;s been this very serious project happening -- but that seeds -- at these major bot@@ an@@ ical gar@@ den@@ s , seeds aren &apos;t on show .
we worked with an a@@ st@@ ro@@ tur@@ f man@@ u@@ f@@ ac@@ tur@@ er to develop a min@@ i@@ -@@ me version of the seed ca@@ the@@ d@@ ra@@ l , so that , even if you &apos;re par@@ ti@@ al@@ l@@ y-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted , that it was kind of cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y and soft , that piece of landscape that you see there .
it &apos;s actually only the first couple of flo@@ ors that you really experience , and the rest of it is just for post@@ cards .
the book is called &quot; the b@@ lan@@ k s@@ late , &quot; based on the popular idea that the human mind is a b@@ lan@@ k s@@ late , and that all of its structure comes from soci@@ alization , culture , par@@ ent@@ ing , experience .
well , there are a number of political reasons why people have found it con@@ gen@@ i@@ al .
it &apos;s not clear , by the way , since then , whether that is an accurate gener@@ alization , but the data at the time seemed to support that .
and the hu@@ man@@ i@@ ties and arts programs in the uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties , which by many me@@ as@@ ur@@ es , indeed are in decline .
well , the other hot button is par@@ ent@@ ing .
and i think that the argument can &apos;t be put any more el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently than that .
i also call pet@@ a , just for fun , and they don &apos;t like it -- but they con@@ fi@@ r@@ m it .
there &apos;s no writing , there &apos;s no sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ting , there &apos;s no non@@ sense .
he &apos;s like , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m thinking right now . &quot;
&quot; oh , i &apos;m living in a computer program &quot; -- that &apos;s weird .
so i started to wonder what would happen if we ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ged some of these s@@ ac@@ red co@@ ws .
right ?
it goes like this -- we &apos;ve de@@ c@@ l@@ ar@@ ed war on work , as a society , all of us .
your iphone without those people making the same interface , the same ci@@ r@@ cu@@ it@@ ry , the same board , over and over ?
and then it got bigger and bigger and bigger , and now it &apos;s 8@@ 8@@ 6 pages long .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did t@@ on@@ y do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; so is it true that you fa@@ ked your way in here ? &quot;
but how do you sit in a san@@ e way ?
so all the things that had seemed most normal about t@@ on@@ y was evidence , according to his c@@ lin@@ i@@ ci@@ an , that he was mad in this new way .
he would come into failing businesses and close down 30 percent of the work@@ force , just turn american to@@ w@@ ns into g@@ host to@@ w@@ ns .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;ve got a list of p@@ sy@@ ch@@ op@@ a@@ th@@ ic tra@@ its in my pocket .
and the ge@@ ms are always the ou@@ ter@@ most as@@ pe@@ cts of our inter@@ vi@@ e@@ we@@ e &apos;s personality .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend was for dis@@ en@@ ga@@ ge@@ ment with the rest of the world .
and as a consequence of this dis@@ ag@@ re@@ em@@ ent , it &apos;s very , very difficult for anyone to say , &quot; i have the right version of islam . &quot;
it may be that there was a great war to be f@@ ought between west and east , and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against com@@ m@@ un@@ ism .
and even though , for political tac@@ tic@@ al reasons , the president has been very , very good about saying that islam is not the enemy , non@@ e@@ th@@ eless , there &apos;s a natural im@@ p@@ ul@@ se when one en@@ ters war to think of the other side as an enemy .
now when the tre@@ as@@ ure s@@ an@@ k in 2000 , it was the height of the best bre@@ e@@ ding season scientists had ever recorded for the african pen@@ gu@@ in -- which at the time , was li@@ sted as a th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed species .
so the day after we arrived , two of us from the a@@ qu@@ ari@@ um were put in charge of room two , and room two had more than 4,000 o@@ iled penguins in it .
and we used this technique again during the tre@@ as@@ ure rescue .
and this is cri@@ tically important because , one year ago , the african pen@@ gu@@ in was de@@ c@@ l@@ ar@@ ed en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed .
corner row ra@@ il@@ way , station car park , front of a health center , people &apos;s front gar@@ den@@ s , and even in front of the police station .
people are ready and respond to the story of food .
so we launched a campaign -- because it just am@@ uses me -- called every e@@ g@@ g matters .
this isn &apos;t a second class exercise .
these do@@ c@@ tr@@ in@@ es seemed un@@ pro@@ v@@ en , abstract .
h@@ il@@ le@@ l stood on one leg and said , &quot; that which is hat@@ e@@ ful to you , do not do to your neighbor . that is the tor@@ ah . the rest is com@@ m@@ ent@@ ary .
now -- but that &apos;s not the whole story .
and then a@@ ch@@ il@@ les takes the body of he@@ ctor , he hands it very ten@@ der@@ ly to the father , and the two men look at each other , and see each other as di@@ v@@ ine .
so when we would look at cells , this is how i really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope .
each sand grain is about a t@@ ent@@ h of a m@@ il@@ li@@ meter in size .
and you can see those in micro@@ me@@ te@@ or@@ ites .
that image was the start of the x-ray technology .
we all look the same inside , believe me .
the walls are 7@@ 0@@ 0 m@@ il@@ li@@ meters thick of solid dense concrete .
the one on the left is an x-ray .
it has human con@@ not@@ ations .
so the x-ray will show the over@@ la@@ ps in these little cor@@ ners .
so , i &apos;ve got to saw the car in half , down the middle , not an easy task , in itself .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys a t@@ y@@ pe@@ writer for a week , and after a week , they only used it as a ba@@ th@@ room .
science actually says we will live forever .
no , i just sp@@ it out a to@@ ot@@ h .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you very much . go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e .
how do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe you and i dis@@ agree .
it is not professor and con@@ vi@@ ct , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
and then life was fine , d@@ and@@ y .
and everything i saw in the cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ation said there were huge fi@@ gh@@ ts amongst the fo@@ o@@ dies between the cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ators and the h@@ un@@ ter@@ -@@ ga@@ ther@@ ers .
would there be time to be able to work with it ?
we &apos;ve spent a great deal of time inv@@ e@@ st@@ ig@@ ating a $ 1 billion -- that &apos;s right , a $ 1 billion — oil deal that he was involved with , and what we found was pretty sho@@ cking , but more about that later .
and then there &apos;s dan e@@ te@@ te .
and we were al@@ ar@@ med to find that these shell companies had quickly fli@@ pped many of the as@@ se@@ ts on for huge pro@@ f@@ its to major international mining companies li@@ sted in london .
it &apos;s too complex and difficult to change .
we all die . we all get old . we all get sick . people leave us .
you have places you cannot go , thoughts you cannot think , worlds that you can no longer in@@ h@@ ab@@ it .
they have a fi@@ er@@ c@@ en@@ ess and a freedom that i believe is the be@@ dro@@ ck of a new paradigm .
she made a decision not to go and get a ra@@ z@@ or or a glass sh@@ ard , but to de@@ vote her life to st@@ op@@ p@@ ing that happening to other girls .
all of us are re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es .
but you cl@@ amp this thing on my head , and something happens .
but you don &apos;t do this . &quot;
i miss michael .
he did not think so , however , but his co@@ workers did an inter@@ ven@@ tion and they said , &quot; you are going to re@@ ha@@ b , or you will be fi@@ red and you will die . &quot;
a@@ h@@ h ! we come upon them , the c@@ lan@@ de@@ st@@ ine lo@@ vers . let &apos;s draw them out .
when it &apos;s on top of the paper board , which is the opposite , it forms this .
the tra@@ its the word ch@@ il@@ dish ad@@ d@@ res@@ ses are seen so often in adults that we should ab@@ o@@ li@@ s@@ h this a@@ ge@@ -@@ dis@@ cri@@ min@@ atory word when it comes to cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zing behavior associated with ir@@ responsibility and ir@@ rational thinking .
if i doubt my older sister &apos;s ability to pay back the 10 percent interest i e@@ st@@ ab@@ li@@ shed on her last lo@@ an , i &apos;m going to with@@ hold her ability to get more money from me until she pa@@ ys it back .
it &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not in the dark ages anymore .
and the third is all of the sound that we humans generate that &apos;s called an@@ th@@ ro@@ ph@@ on@@ y .
this is after s@@ el@@ e@@ ctive lo@@ g@@ ging .
there are many f@@ ac@@ ets to so@@ und@@ sc@@ ap@@ es , among them the ways in which animals taught us to dance and sing , which i &apos;ll save for another time .
so this was extremely em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sing .
and if you &apos;re wondering how much 16@@ k is , this e@@ bay lo@@ go here is 16@@ k .
so 3@@ 7 is our target audience .
it &apos;s very , very e@@ pi@@ c and a very beautiful con@@ c@@ er@@ t .
and these are the kind of t@@ op@@ ics we really actually care about .
a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world .
these are all tr@@ ou@@ bles outside of myself .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games holds for our civilization .
you &apos;re off , you &apos;re off . that &apos;s it .
he would have a great time .
so one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more . we like more .
now she had them look at them and do this ... l@@ ab@@ ori@@ ous , which i thought for a long time , until she explained to me was to slow them down so they &apos;ll think .
make it go in the other direction .
student 4@@ l : &#91; i decided to &#93; do the shot put and the s@@ po@@ n@@ ge ball because they &apos;re two totally different w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ts , and if you drop them at the same time , maybe they &apos;ll drop at the same speed .
but we couldn &apos;t create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life .
and ther@@ e@@ by han@@ gs a t@@ al@@ e . &quot;
before it &apos;s all done we are going to al@@ ter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have amazing im@@ p@@ ac@@ ts .
why do you do what you do ?
they &apos;ll want the new release .
they touch us too deeply .
and they are actually going to ro@@ man@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze this moment in time .
again , i &apos;ll use the words in the same order he did .
and i said , &quot; well , funny you should ask .
and she said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t have to do that again . &quot;
and we watched them and i &apos;m so th@@ an@@ k@@ ful , because she &apos;s just like , &quot; wow ! this is so amazing . &quot;
the project a@@ im is really quite simple .
so this is absolutely per@@ son@@ alized medicine at its best really .
well the answer to that is a multi@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ in@@ ary team .
i was working with im@@ per@@ i@@ al and the bro@@ m@@ p@@ ton , and this generated some serious problems with the project , really problems that shouldn &apos;t exist .
so many people in the medical world don &apos;t want to change , particularly not when some j@@ um@@ pe@@ d-@@ up engineer has come along with the answer .
you can find novel solutions , really novel solutions , that have never been looked at before very , very quickly and easily .
yeah well , you guys are making my life mis@@ er@@ able because track pa@@ ds used to be round , a nice round shape .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i went to see the do@@ z@@ o .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to do nice car@@ to@@ ons .
thank you .
well , &quot; rare earth &quot; actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public .
we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now , till we hit the second micro@@ bi@@ al age .
the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet , and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs , the death of these beautiful am@@ mon@@ it@@ es , le@@ con@@ t@@ ei@@ c@@ er@@ as here , and c@@ el@@ a@@ e@@ c@@ er@@ as over here , and so much else .
this is the top car@@ ni@@ v@@ or@@ e , the t-@@ re@@ x of its time .
they hate we animals .
this is when de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ earth material comes to the surface , sp@@ re@@ ads out over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m 80 miles from sh@@ ore , what &apos;s going to happen to me ?
you &apos;re in an accident . you &apos;ve got two choices : you &apos;re going to die , or you &apos;re going to take the hydrogen su@@ l@@ fi@@ de and , say , 75 percent of you is saved , m@@ ent@@ ally .
p@@ w : bl@@ es@@ s@@ ing and cur@@ se .
some of them are just countries who believe that der@@ e@@ gu@@ lation or no re@@ gu@@ lation is the best way to at@@ tra@@ ct investment , pro@@ mo@@ te trade .
and the answer is quite simple : the chinese define these f@@ ac@@ i@@ li@@ ties as chemical f@@ ac@@ i@@ li@@ ties , not ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ al f@@ ac@@ i@@ li@@ ties , so they don &apos;t au@@ d@@ it them .
i don &apos;t know how to prevent that , but i &apos;m at least going to use my good o@@ ff@@ ic@@ es to get you folks together to come up with a response . &quot;
you need a safe space .
we &apos;re now thinking that , in fact , this is probably the start of a new way of re@@ g@@ ul@@ ating and ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing international challenges .
and human rights comes down to a very simple pro@@ position : can i give this person their dignity back ?
or else find the boy who li@@ t the fire in the first place , to see if you can change him . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was ho@@ o@@ ked .
and we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cra@@ cks open lo@@ cks .
after the race , he to@@ s@@ sed his we@@ t , cl@@ ou@@ d-@@ white hair and said , &apos; you &apos;re a god . &apos; no , an@@ der@@ son , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot while i &apos;m teaching , and i don &apos;t always get to watch all of my students reach their step three , but i was very lucky with char@@ l@@ ot@@ te , that i got to watch her journey un@@ fold the way it did .
my parents named me s@@ ar@@ ah , which is a bi@@ b@@ li@@ cal name .
i &apos;d like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that mo@@ ti@@ v@@ ated me to become a do@@ c@@ um@@ ent@@ ary photographer .
seeing the war created such incredibly high sta@@ kes for everyone involved and that visual j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ alism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution -- i wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer .
at the same time in south africa , after n@@ el@@ son m@@ and@@ el@@ a had been released from prison , the black population com@@ men@@ ced the final phase of li@@ ber@@ ation from a@@ par@@ th@@ ei@@ d .
the next day i left for rwanda , and it was like taking the express el@@ e@@ v@@ ator to hell .
after the fall of su@@ har@@ to in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , i began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards mo@@ der@@ ni@@ zation .
an m@@ s@@ f hospital in a camp for dis@@ placed people .
military medicine has become so efficient that the percentage of tro@@ op@@ s who survive after being wo@@ und@@ ed is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history .
to make sure as few things as possible go wrong , we have all these pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ur@@ es around the election .
so this is how you vote .
but it &apos;s a bro@@ ad and very de@@ li@@ c@@ ate subject , so i have to li@@ mit myself .
the size is the population -- big china , big india here .
and all the eastern religions except japan had the same level .
because the death of a child is comp@@ en@@ s@@ ated by one more child .
and what is the reason in q@@ at@@ ar ?
they are quite useful for educational pur@@ pos@@ es .
all the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world .
and then , like everyone else in our generation , we went to live in a hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ an mon@@ a@@ st@@ er@@ y .
day eight .
in india alone , my 1@@ 5@@ 0,000 best friends and i went door to door with that same picture to every single house in india . we made over one billion house calls .
that is the sur@@ v@@ ei@@ l@@ lan@@ ce system .
i asked them -- these are all flu@@ ologists and speci@@ alists in in@@ flu@@ en@@ z@@ a -- and i asked them the questions you &apos;d like to ask them .
and i think we o@@ we a great de@@ b@@ t of gra@@ ti@@ tu@@ de to g@@ ph@@ in and to r@@ on st@@ . john , who i hope is in the audience some place -- over there -- who &apos;s the fo@@ under of g@@ ph@@ in .
l@@ ar@@ ry brilliant : first of all , you &apos;re not mad about the copyright vi@@ ol@@ ation ?
i set up a climate change n@@ go called the climate group .
why would we not want to have a positive impact on the world as a business ?
you save 8@@ 5 percent of the electricity with an led that you would have done in an old in@@ c@@ and@@ es@@ cent .
people sometimes think that 100 percent &apos;s going to be hard , and we &apos;ve had the conversation in the business .
a solar pan@@ el pa@@ ys for itself in seven or eight years .
so we know for our 17@@ ,000 man@@ a@@ gers across i@@ ke@@ a that 4@@ 7 percent are women today , but it &apos;s not enough , and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to sen@@ i@@ or management .
there was this equation in my family that went something like this : if you are intelligent , you therefore are not spiritual .
this , &quot; he wrote , &quot; is the inter@@ related structure of reality . &quot;
anyone whose lifestyle may fri@@ gh@@ ten you , or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears .
by the end of our lunch , we ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ged each other &apos;s openness .
as always , i would return to b@@ an@@ g@@ al@@ ore , and often to an@@ i@@ ma@@ ted dis@@ c@@ us@@ sions at friend &apos;s homes , where we would dis@@ c@@ us@@ s various issues while they com@@ pla@@ ined b@@ it@@ ter@@ ly about the new pu@@ b ti@@ m@@ ings , where a drink often cost more than what they &apos;d paid their 14@@ -year-old ma@@ id .
he se@@ e@@ ked for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess , and he c@@ la@@ im@@ s to en@@ de@@ a@@ v@@ or to improve the lives of his ch@@ il@@ d-@@ soldiers .
this con@@ t@@ ing@@ ent seems to be quite lucky , and it has not su@@ sta@@ ined any cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties , even though do@@ z@@ ens of pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ke@@ e@@ pers have been killed in li@@ ber@@ ia .
and how are we responsible for this ?
it &apos;s a worry -- isn &apos;t it ? -- that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of ac@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
j yeah . so this became front page of the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an and was then pr@@ in@@ ted in all the sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ing countries of kenya , in tan@@ z@@ ani@@ an and south african press .
j the impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
and there &apos;s a lot of information .
i &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far -- i &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the ted audience .
and we were like , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with ha@@ cker .
and just a month ago , this was passed by the ic@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ am@@ ent un@@ an@@ im@@ ously .
and from all of these numbers , i start with only two or three v@@ ari@@ ab@@ les .
this piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it .
i first learned about it through a la@@ w@@ suit i read about in my doctor &apos;s office -- which was between the ph@@ y@@ si@@ ci@@ an &apos;s com@@ mit@@ te@@ e for responsible medicine and seven different fast food re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts .
so the best way to mar@@ in@@ ate chicken , based on this , is to , not under@@ -@@ cook , but definitely don &apos;t over@@ -@@ cook and ch@@ ar the chicken , and mar@@ in@@ ate in either le@@ m@@ on ju@@ ice , brown sugar or sal@@ t@@ water .
and then went on , my next summer , to work under dr. bas@@ u at the un@@ t health center at for@@ t worth , texas .
and that &apos;s huge for che@@ mo@@ therapy e@@ ff@@ e@@ c@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess -- possibly for many different types of cancer .
for example , v@@ ol@@ a@@ ti@@ le organic com@@ pounds are chemical po@@ l@@ lu@@ tan@@ ts that are found in our schools , homes and work@@ places .
because these solutions are natural , these solutions are sustainable , and these solutions are long-term inv@@ e@@ st@@ ments -- long-term inv@@ e@@ st@@ ments that we &apos;re making for our generation and for future generations .
and immediately a voice sh@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; k@@ an@@ g@@ ar@@ o@@ o ! &quot;
and people would come up to me after the conference , after my talk , men and women .
heavy !
a pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic limb doesn &apos;t represent the need to replace loss anymore .
we are all different from different per@@ spe@@ c@@ ti@@ ves .
i was in b@@ ei@@ j@@ ing &apos;s bi@@ d@@ ding for the ol@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ic games .
about 80 percent of those micro@@ b@@ lo@@ g@@ gers are young people , under 30 years old .
and they &apos;re more vulnerable to job lo@@ s@@ ses , subject to in@@ f@@ lation , ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing lo@@ ans from ban@@ ks , app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation of the ren@@ min@@ b@@ i , or decline of demand from europe or america for the products they produce .
they have sorts of ingredients that you br@@ us@@ h on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like be@@ e@@ f .
people are thinking about the following questions : are we going to s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce our environment further to produce higher gdp ?
there is nothing to eat up here , but the conditions were ideal for hi@@ ber@@ nation .
now , the series hasn &apos;t even a@@ i@@ red yet , so you &apos;re the very first to see this .
more like mars than earth , it seems just as ho@@ sti@@ le to life .
s@@ ou@@ s@@ a &apos;s fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these , quote , &quot; in@@ f@@ er@@ n@@ al machines . &quot; they would take it away .
but most important was that b@@ m@@ i took public do@@ main works and made ar@@ r@@ an@@ ge@@ ments of them , which they gave away for free to their sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ ber@@ s . so that in 19@@ 40 , when as@@ cap th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed to double their rates , the majority of bro@@ ad@@ ca@@ sters s@@ wi@@ t@@ ched to b@@ m@@ i .
and i .@@ ...
now , the balance that i try to fight for , i , as any good liberal , try to fight for first by looking to the government . total mistake , right ?
that re@@ ali@@ zation is ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ari@@ ly cor@@ ro@@ sive , ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ari@@ ly cor@@ ru@@ p@@ ting .
okay , now i don &apos;t want to al@@ arm anybody in this room , but it &apos;s just come to my attention that the person to your right is a li@@ ar .
&quot; h@@ on@@ ey , you don &apos;t look fat in that , no . &quot;
but in another study , it showed that st@@ r@@ an@@ gers li@@ ed three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other .
here &apos;s ko@@ k@@ o with her k@@ it@@ ten .
i &apos;m going to say this again .
we think li@@ ars won &apos;t look you in the eyes .
we say &quot; yes , &quot; we shake our heads &quot; no . &quot;
science has sur@@ faced many , many more indi@@ cat@@ ors .
and if you look closely , you &apos;ll see du@@ ping de@@ light throughout this video .
so in this much no@@ is@@ i@@ er world , it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more ex@@ p@@ li@@ c@@ it about our moral code .
which it isn &apos;t really , is it ?
you know , we often think that language mi@@ r@@ r@@ ors the world in which we live , and i find that &apos;s not true .
so what seems like an e@@ c@@ c@@ ent@@ ri@@ c if tra@@ gi@@ c joke about har@@ ry becomes a way to spread e@@ th@@ ni@@ c hat@@ red .
six months after that , with no explanation , they let me go .
and this is the di@@ ff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty that i face .
when i was 10 , i read james bal@@ d@@ win &apos;s &quot; another country , &quot; and that book broke me .
now i have be@@ at@@ en a song back into you .
so that &apos;s why i took a bit of time to study co@@ ke .
and in africa , the remote places , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you in@@ cent them based on the impact that they &apos;re getting out in those remote villages ? &quot;
it doesn &apos;t sound anything like &quot; wa@@ v@@ in &apos; fla@@ g &quot; to me .
they &apos;re waiting to be ci@@ r@@ c@@ um@@ c@@ is@@ ed .
so many more people would have been affected .
i &apos;m going to tell you two things today : one is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
this is where you can see most of the fl@@ ori@@ da ke@@ ys national marine san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
if we don &apos;t have fishing because these re@@ e@@ f@@ s are protected by law or their re@@ m@@ ot@@ en@@ ess , this is great .
after a few years , between five and seven years , fish come back , they eat the ur@@ ch@@ ins , and then the al@@ ga@@ e grow again .
you can see where the limits of the res@@ er@@ ve are because you see the bo@@ ats lin@@ ed up .
if this is so good , if this is such a no@@ -@@ bra@@ in@@ er , how much of this do we have ?
so marine conservation and co@@ a@@ st@@ al protection has become a sin@@ k for government or ph@@ il@@ an@@ th@@ ro@@ pi@@ c money , and this is not sustainable .
what we found in coral re@@ e@@ f@@ s is that the in@@ ver@@ ted pyramid is the equivalent of the ser@@ en@@ ge@@ t@@ i , with five li@@ ons per wil@@ de@@ be@@ est .
well , en@@ ri@@ c , thank you so much for sharing some of that spiritual experience with us all . thank you .
this turns out to be the lon@@ g@@ es@@ t creature in the oceans .
they come right up to the sub@@ marine -- they &apos;ll put their eyes right up to the window and pe@@ e@@ k inside the su@@ b .
one of the things we &apos;re trying to do at wo@@ o@@ ds hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world -- this world , this un@@ ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ed region -- back to the laboratory .
b@@ l : these wor@@ ms have no di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve system . they have no mouth .
what we saw up till now was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you high definition from the pacific .
the wor@@ ms are growing inches per week !
the concept of pres@@ er@@ v@@ ation is fu@@ ti@@ le .
and then the other one percent is e@@ a@@ ger@@ ly looking for the for@@ mul@@ a to apply in that situation .
you also have the mathematical structure , talking about gri@@ ds , me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ ments , l@@ ab@@ els , points , a@@ x@@ es , that sort of thing .
students have to develop those , they have to for@@ mu@@ late those .
and the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edi@@ tion .
what ever happened to the small ha@@ dr@@ on col@@ li@@ der ?
this is where you &apos;ll find the fa@@ st@@ est growing young populations of the world .
they &apos;re private schools . there are no state schools in sl@@ um@@ s .
this is a computer in@@ st@@ al@@ l@@ ed in the ent@@ r@@ ance to their sl@@ um by a re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ ti@@ on@@ ary social ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ eu@@ r called su@@ g@@ at@@ a mit@@ ra who has con@@ du@@ cted the most radical experiments , showing that children , in the right conditions , can learn on their own with the help of computers .
well , the key is motivation , and there are two as@@ pe@@ cts to it .
so this is a school in a bus on a building site in pun@@ e , the fa@@ st@@ est growing city in asia .
you should turn it into mc@@ don@@ al@@ d &apos;s .
there are for@@ ma@@ l se@@ tt@@ ings -- schools , col@@ le@@ ges , hospitals -- in which innovation can take place , and in@@ for@@ ma@@ l se@@ tt@@ ings -- communities , families , social networks .
every child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school will be able to have one in 20@@ 15 .
so as i &apos;m watching this , i see this powerful scene that brought me to te@@ ars , and it stuck with me for the past 25 years .
any parents out there of teenagers ? all we do is cook for these people -- they eat two , three , four din@@ ners a night -- it &apos;s ridiculous !
it goes and goes and en@@ g@@ ul@@ f@@ s !
these ga@@ ys , people like me , want to be treated like full citizens and it &apos;s all written down in pla@@ in sight .
there are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don &apos;t show anyone who they really are right here at home . this isn &apos;t just about north car@@ ol@@ in@@ a ; all those states that were clear , it &apos;s legal .
think about that .
and i got scared .
about three years ago , i read an article in the new york times .
who were my grand@@ parents ?
it helps us become what we might have been .
evolution works that way .
and sure enough , there &apos;s the in@@ se@@ ct .
i actually s@@ m@@ el@@ t someone with some on earlier .
not only will it raise itself to 1@@ 15 fa@@ h@@ r@@ en@@ h@@ ei@@ t , 4@@ 3 or 4@@ 4 degrees c@@ en@@ ti@@ grade , for two days , but it keeps constant temperature .
but the contrast will look something like that , so standing out a lot from the background .
and this is when the americans beat the r@@ us@@ si@@ ans , and this was -- yes , it was te@@ ch@@ ni@@ cally a game .
so she pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ded to tell me , and so any of you who are parents will recognize the b@@ ing@@ o bu@@ zz@@ words here .
my history is ir@@ ish .
our lives are being driven by data , and the presentation of that data is an opportunity for us to make some amazing inter@@ faces that tell great stories .
i started taking a look as well at different per@@ i@@ meters , because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data .
there &apos;s actually a le@@ gl@@ ess man that si@@ ts in that box and controls this ch@@ ess player .
ap@@ pro@@ x@@ i@@ ma@@ te collection rate of 11 sheep per hour , which would make a working wa@@ ge of 6@@ 9 cents per hour .
this basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame , and on the right side you see that frame as inter@@ pre@@ ted by 16 people who have no idea what it is they &apos;re doing .
da@@ is@@ y bell : da@@ is@@ y , da@@ is@@ y ... a@@ ar@@ on k@@ ob@@ li@@ n : and we took all of those individual pieces , and we fed them into another tur@@ k re@@ qu@@ est .
but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of r@@ ally behind and build something for .
and below it are all the individual fra@@ m@@ es that people have been sub@@ mit@@ ting to the project .
thanks a lot .
so i made series of images , cu@@ tt@@ ings , and i as@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ ed them in por@@ t@@ fo@@ li@@ os .
so the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image , so it makes a very fre@@ e@@ st@@ y@@ le architecture .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , such as the 2010 ha@@ i@@ ti@@ an earthquake .
then i went to run 5@@ 0@@ k , then 6@@ 0@@ k .
so it &apos;s like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity .
another glass project is in a public library in san jo@@ se , california .
so each building has its own personality .
it &apos;s perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living .
i don &apos;t think we are particularly ma@@ ter@@ i@@ ali@@ stic .
she &apos;s simply too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , when you met a very poor person , that person would be described as an &quot; un@@ fortunate &quot; -- literally , somebody who had not been bl@@ es@@ s@@ ed by fortune , an un@@ fortunate .
and he &apos;s going to do that on the day of ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment with an@@ g@@ el@@ s and tr@@ um@@ p@@ ets , and the sk@@ ies will open .
i gave them the pl@@ ot@@ line of ma@@ d@@ am@@ e bo@@ v@@ ary .
what i think i &apos;ve been talking about really is success and failure .
and make sure that we own them , that we are truly the au@@ th@@ ors of our own am@@ bi@@ tions .
al@@ ain de bot@@ ton : a k@@ in@@ der , g@@ ent@@ ler philosophy of success
and when you &apos;re training for this sport , you are not s@@ m@@ il@@ ing .
you know , you &apos;re swimming with the fo@@ g@@ ged go@@ g@@ gl@@ es , you &apos;re swimming at 60 st@@ ro@@ kes a minute , so you &apos;re never really focused on anything , you don &apos;t see well .
you &apos;re im@@ m@@ er@@ sed in the liquid .
my breath is down to three bre@@ a@@ ths a minute .
they should worry about me . i don &apos;t worry about them .
i was swimming with this thing on .
it &apos;s the only swim i &apos;m interested in .
this is already available today .
g@@ at@@ e@@ way could be a s@@ mar@@ t@@ phone or it could be a dedicated g@@ at@@ e@@ way , as today many of these things are dedicated g@@ at@@ e@@ ways , because they are not so well integrated .
a lot of you have gotten that ph@@ il@@ li@@ ps direct life .
this is an important part of our life , one-@@ third you &apos;re supposed to be sleeping .
ok . now let &apos;s move from sleep to diseases .
so , we can change medicine across the con@@ tin@@ u@@ um of care , across the ages from pre@@ mi@@ es or un@@ born children to sen@@ i@@ ors ; the ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ al ar@@ en@@ a changes ; the full spectrum of disease -- i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of that -- across the globe .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you of this , of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally im@@ pres@@ sive across all these different diseases and more .
how do we make stable societies ? lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
and in the novel , a particular one named al@@ v@@ in is created . and he says , maybe this isn &apos;t the best way , and w@@ re@@ cks the whole system .
and so there won &apos;t be any work@@ force .
and it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
ste@@ am@@ ing ought to be faster .
now you might wonder , how do we make these cu@@ ta@@ ways ?
we have the only co@@ o@@ k@@ book in the world that has par@@ ti@@ al di@@ ff@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ al e@@ qu@@ ations in it .
here &apos;s the final ham@@ bur@@ ger .
a talk about sur@@ gi@@ cal robots is also a talk about surgery .
and sur@@ ge@@ ons were tra@@ des@@ men , rather than ph@@ y@@ si@@ ci@@ ans .
but eventually they did come around .
they had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments .
i talked about the large , complicated robot .
and as you see it come out , in order to actually be able to do anything useful , it can &apos;t all stay c@@ lu@@ st@@ er@@ ed up like this .
and we don &apos;t even need to con@@ fine ourselves to this ma@@ cr@@ o vision .
mi@@ r@@ and@@ a w@@ an@@ g : we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
m@@ w : okay . well , it was par@@ ti@@ ally my f@@ au@@ lt .
we have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution , but also that being open to un@@ certain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries .
the film that we &apos;re about to see is a film they made for the mo@@ s@@ cow world &apos;s fair .
i &apos;m no ex@@ ce@@ p@@ tion .
it continued . they were always trying to make thing better and better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style is cur@@ ves . let &apos;s make the house cur@@ v@@ y . &quot;
and i think in our family we were very lucky , because we learned about design backwards .
da@@ wn , very good .
ed : and then em@@ bas@@ sy row is actually a historical site , because in the k@@ y@@ ma@@ er@@ i@@ can story this is where the par@@ is@@ i@@ an di@@ as@@ por@@ a started , where there em@@ bas@@ sy was .
see that chair there ? the orange one ? that &apos;s the organic chair . 19@@ 40 .
because that &apos;s part of where we &apos;ve got to get to .
they were press pieces and they were full of ou@@ tra@@ ge , they were full of spe@@ cu@@ lation , they were an@@ e@@ c@@ d@@ ot@@ al -- no solid information .
one we all know about , the population explo@@ sion : the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
br@@ ent la@@ w@@ son : happy to be here .
you can see that the lines cross when the population explo@@ des .
well , first , before i even tell you the cost i &apos;ve got to be absolutely clear .
this is what li@@ ber@@ ation really looks like .
however , only recently , due to several technological ad@@ van@@ c@@ em@@ ents , we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum le@@ vi@@ tation and quantum lo@@ cking .
well , first there are st@@ r@@ and@@ s of magnetic field left inside , but now the super@@ con@@ du@@ ctor doesn &apos;t like them moving around , because their movements dis@@ si@@ pa@@ te energy , which breaks the super@@ con@@ du@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty state .
now , i can ex@@ tend this ci@@ r@@ cul@@ ar ma@@ g@@ net , and make whatever track i want .
and it was also inspired by this quote from d@@ ou@@ gl@@ as ad@@ am@@ s , and the situation is from &quot; the h@@ it@@ ch@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s guide to the galaxy . &quot;
because , of course , they don &apos;t actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself and you don &apos;t have a s@@ m@@ el@@ ting plant .
but even then they weren &apos;t convinced and said , &quot; okay , we &apos;ll phone you back &quot; -- never did .
t@@ t : yeah , i did pl@@ u@@ g it in .
so people say , &quot; what &apos;s going to happen when mo@@ ore &apos;s law comes to an end ? &quot;
you can buy half a billion today , and they are actually better , because they are faster .
but where will we get the software ?
but l@@ ar@@ ry page made an im@@ p@@ as@@ si@@ on@@ ed speech at our or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ zing meeting , saying we should de@@ vote this study to actually ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing some of the major challenges facing humanity .
they were trying to catch fish .
this may seem min@@ or , but it is ter@@ ri@@ fying to hear ru@@ m@@ or after ru@@ m@@ or after ru@@ m@@ or that another ti@@ d@@ al wave , bigger than the last , will be coming at exactly 1 p@@ .@@ m@@ . , or perhaps tonight , or perhaps ...
and so in some ways the t@@ s@@ un@@ am@@ i can be seen as a sort of se@@ min@@ al moment , a moment in which the b@@ lo@@ go@@ sphere came , to a certain degree , of age .
it would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of be@@ ans in the j@@ ar , and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you .
people have linked to it , and so other people in turn link to it , etc . , etc .
he fin@@ is@@ h@@ es explaining that , and i &apos;m waiting for the big 300 po@@ un@@ d paper pro@@ pos@@ al , and he said , &quot; that &apos;s what i want from you . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now , without the skin on it , a 3@@ 0@@ -@@ second piece , and then i &apos;m done .
this type of habitat co@@ vers more of the earth &apos;s surface than all other h@@ ab@@ it@@ ats combined .
now most of us , and i would say me in@@ c@@ lu@@ ded , think that human explo@@ it@@ ation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last 50 to , perhaps , 100 years or so .
so these are te@@ ther@@ ed vehicles we lower down to the sea floor where they &apos;re our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom .
and so there &apos;s a bar@@ code on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is .
but i will tell you some of my favorite discoveries from the c@@ en@@ su@@ s .
we don &apos;t know why they conver@@ ge there , we simply don &apos;t know .
now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper that &apos;s going to come out in the j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ al p@@ los biology .
and there are a lot of other pres@@ sur@@ es .
as an architect , i have to con@@ front something like this .
mit@@ ch@@ el@@ l jo@@ ach@@ im : don &apos;t build your home , grow it !
and i find that very interesting and very pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive , because what you &apos;ve been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions : directions that are specific and unique to problems .
now , we all think that sh@@ el@@ ley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was ; many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful es@@ says , too , and the most well-@@ re@@ me@@ m@@ ber@@ ed es@@ say is one called &quot; a de@@ f@@ ence of poetry . &quot;
and i &apos;ll read you what it is .
and at some point of its life , it im@@ plants on a rock .
but let me show you cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge ro@@ bo@@ tics .
so the old days before digital radio when you were t@@ un@@ ing in your radio and you heard &quot; cr@@ r@@ c@@ ck@@ k@@ k &quot; on the station you wanted to hear , that was the noise .
and the key idea to ba@@ y@@ es@@ ian in@@ fer@@ ence is you have two sources of information from which to make your in@@ fer@@ ence .
so that really means i have to make predictions of the future .
well there &apos;s one very clear example where a sen@@ sa@@ tion generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person .
and in the inter@@ ven@@ ing years i had two d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters .
so they don &apos;t know the rules the other person &apos;s playing by .
if these dots were cars going on a ra@@ cing circuit , you would have absolutely no idea what &apos;s going on .
so we &apos;ve shown that using this , we can explain a huge amount of data -- that exactly people are going about their lives planning movements so as to min@@ i@@ mi@@ ze negative consequences of noise .
this is fl@@ y-@@ by , mar@@ in@@ er i@@ v .
mars has the largest impact cr@@ at@@ er in the solar system , h@@ ell@@ as bas@@ in .
this is my favorite picture . this was just taken a few weeks ago .
the oldest rock on earth is only 3@@ .@@ 6 billion .
and the result of our meeting was a robotic ro@@ ck@@ et@@ -@@ powered airplane we call ar@@ es .
we fold it , and we transport it in a sp@@ ac@@ e@@ cra@@ ft .
this is over ti@@ lam@@ o@@ ok , or@@ e@@ g@@ on .
i think the box says -- let &apos;s see here -- &quot; 8 to 12 &quot; on it .
and there &apos;s a du@@ de selling these af@@ ter@@ market weapons for le@@ go , because le@@ go -- the dan@@ ish -- no , they &apos;re not into g@@ un@@ s .
and then , just some examples . this stuff really is sculpture .
i &apos;ve got to tell you , for me , everything changed that evening .
and maybe most important , they have a big effect on other companies .
in fact , policy is par@@ amount .
they now have 2@@ 9@@ ,000 e@@ th@@ an@@ ol pu@@ m@@ p@@ s -- this versus 7@@ 0@@ 0 in the u.s. , and a pal@@ try two in california -- and in three years their new car fle@@ et has gone from four percent to 8@@ 5 percent fle@@ x@@ -@@ fuel .
don &apos;t let me sk@@ i@@ p over that . better bio@@ fuels are a really big deal .
the scientists tell us -- and they &apos;re only gu@@ es@@ s@@ ing -- that we &apos;ve got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half , and do it as fast as possible .
i can &apos;t wait to see what we te@@ d@@ sters do about this crisis .
there are fewer and fewer people who are still available that you might in@@ fe@@ ct , and then you get the pl@@ at@@ e@@ a@@ u of the curve , and you get this classic si@@ g@@ mo@@ i@@ d@@ al curve .
b is lo@@ cated on the edge of the network .
and that happens at every per@@ i@@ p@@ her@@ al no@@ de .
the red dots are going to be cases of the flu , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu .
would you get any po@@ pu@@ la@@ ti@@ on@@ -@@ level im@@ m@@ un@@ ity ?
and there are three ways , i think , that these mas@@ si@@ v@@ e-@@ p@@ as@@ si@@ ve data can be used .
the building was under construction until the collapse of the ven@@ e@@ z@@ u@@ el@@ an economy and the death of the de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ er in the early &apos; 9@@ 0@@ s .
while it may appear to be a completely ch@@ a@@ o@@ tic place , when you see it from above , there seems to be a whole grid of water@@ ways and can@@ als connecting each and every home .
in this tradition , the bri@@ de@@ -@@ to-@@ be dis@@ plays all of their bel@@ on@@ g@@ ings , which they soon bring to their new husband .
what makes places like the tor@@ re david particularly remarkable is this sort of skeleton framework where people can have a foundation where they can ta@@ p into .
and we can just ask : &quot; what are the names of s@@ ant@@ a &apos;s rein@@ de@@ er ? &quot; and be told in@@ st@@ ant@@ ly -- or anything else we want to ask .
it &apos;s dis@@ placed the worker from the technology .
you can see some i@@ con@@ s on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older and older .
or even , as we get very much older , driving our cars to go visit people .
they were gone in an in@@ st@@ ant .
it was getting more and more app@@ ar@@ ent that we &apos;re fighting a losing battle .
the two wi@@ z@@ ar@@ ds that i have that are behind the cur@@ ta@@ in will help me bring the results on the screen .
and one of the j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ alists said to her , what &apos;s up ?
e@@ v@@ an@@ ge@@ li@@ c@@ als have joined it . jewish groups have joined it .
i think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on b@@ ri@@ e@@ fly .
he was drawn to the fl@@ am@@ es , he ch@@ as@@ ed the fl@@ am@@ es , he was like a m@@ ot@@ h to the fl@@ am@@ es . something of an ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in j@@ un@@ k@@ ie .
let me go do@@ or@@ -@@ to-@@ door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or tro@@ op@@ s to do the se@@ par@@ ation .
but it was too late for ser@@ gi@@ o .
he saw them .
s@@ am@@ an@@ th@@ a power : a complicated hero
this is jobs and opportunity all the way up and down the value chain .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about access to food , because actually this year and last year and during the 2008 food crisis , there was enough food on earth for everyone to have 2@@ ,@@ 7@@ 0@@ 0 ki@@ lo@@ cal@@ or@@ ies .
and i go to those sh@@ op@@ s , if there are any , or out to the fields to see what they can get , and they cannot ob@@ ta@@ in the nu@@ tri@@ tion .
we see a transformation in atten@@ dance by girls .
i &apos;d like to talk about what i call digital food .
and what i &apos;ve found is , rather than inv@@ e@@ st@@ ing their money in food sub@@ si@@ dies and other things , they inv@@ e@@ st@@ ed in a school feeding program .
thank you .
we could do the same in cancer .
you will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic .
it &apos;s not in the abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing device , not because it tells me how many ki@@ lo@@ cal@@ or@@ ies i do every day , but because it looks , over 24 hours , what i &apos;ve done in a day .
it &apos;s never been shown .
the power of these ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ts , the power of what we can do here , is that we can see an individual ne@@ u@@ tr@@ on with this technology .
you don &apos;t need to s@@ h@@ r@@ ink the disease .
and so we can ac@@ cur@@ at@@ ely -- if the ma@@ g@@ net is big enough , and your resolution is high enough -- you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding of the individual system .
most people find that very so@@ o@@ thing , and , interestingly , 12 cy@@ c@@ les per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human .
so if i were to play this -- -- for more than a few seconds , you &apos;d feel un@@ comfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you &apos;d be leaving the room in dro@@ ves .
you all recognize that one . this is the mo@@ st-@@ played t@@ un@@ e in the world today .
and i stood there b@@ es@@ i@@ de two very good friends of mine , richard we@@ ber and k@@ e@@ v@@ in v@@ al@@ l@@ ely .
crossing miles and miles of sa@@ st@@ ru@@ g@@ i -- frozen ice s@@ no@@ w@@ dri@@ f@@ ts that could be hi@@ p@@ -@@ deep .
as i stand here today talking to you guys , i &apos;ve been running for the grand sum of five years .
it was six miles o@@ ff@@ sh@@ ore and 1,@@ 250 feet down .
the ocean drives climate and weather , st@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ zes temperature , shapes earth &apos;s chemistry .
one-@@ way tri@@ ps are easy .
this is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea .
in the last three years , for example , the u.s. protected 3@@ 4@@ 0,000 square miles of ocean as national mon@@ um@@ ents .
we need de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ di@@ ving sub@@ s , new technologies to explore the ocean .
well , i spent a lot of my early career trying to figure out how in@@ se@@ ct w@@ ings generate enough force to keep the flies in the air .
and let &apos;s explore this notion of simplicity .
so this is a beautiful image of a visual inter@@ neuron from a mouse that came from je@@ ff li@@ ch@@ t@@ man &apos;s lab , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
you s@@ el@@ e@@ ct one set of cells to perform one sort of behavior , another neuro@@ mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ator , another set of cells , a different pattern , and you can imagine you could ex@@ tra@@ po@@ late to a very , very complicated system .
our mission is to build a de@@ ta@@ iled , re@@ ali@@ stic computer model of the human brain .
he &apos;s at home having tea .
if you zoom into the surface of the ne@@ o@@ cortex , you discover that it &apos;s made up of little mo@@ d@@ ul@@ es , g@@ 5 pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ors , like in a computer .
how many of each type of tree do you have ? where are they pos@@ i@@ ti@@ on@@ ed ?
we can look at the f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c . and we can change neurons .
we can load up all the neurons , each one on to its pro@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ or , and fire it up , and see what happens .
h@@ en@@ ry mar@@ k@@ ra@@ m says the my@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ es of the mind can be solved -- soon . mental illness , memory , perception : they &apos;re made of neurons and electric signals , and he plans to find them with a super@@ computer that models all the brain &apos;s 10@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0,000 sy@@ na@@ p@@ ses .
it would take 2,000 or 3,000 b@@ om@@ bs .
the air force started to build smaller models and actually started doing this .
so this is what nasa did , getting an eight man version that would go to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about ir@@ rational behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write , because there is so much feedback you can get from people .
the bottom one ? yellow .
when you ask people this question , they usually think that it has to be something about culture .
the countries on the right , the ones that give a lot , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;ll give you one more example for this .
but pulling them back , all of the sudden becomes more complex .
an online sub@@ sc@@ ri@@ p@@ tion for 5@@ 9 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we actually don &apos;t know our pre@@ fer@@ en@@ ces that well .
in fact in medical terms , that &apos;s our view .
and radio waves are limited .
in@@ f@@ r@@ ar@@ ed -- due to eye safety re@@ gu@@ la@@ tions , can be only used with low power .
its in@@ ten@@ si@@ ty can be mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ated at very high spe@@ e@@ ds , and it can be s@@ wi@@ t@@ ched off at very high spe@@ e@@ ds .
you &apos;re critical .
that &apos;s aside .
cars have le@@ d-@@ based head@@ lights , le@@ d-@@ based back lights , and cars can communicate with each other and prevent accidents traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on .
and one thing that is common to all of life is dna .
it &apos;s not really all that much data .
you will give your genome to the ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ ist , and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were -- you won &apos;t have side effects .
very simple -- only has about 2@@ 4@@ 6 genes -- but we were able to completely sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ ize that genome .
in other words , we &apos;re not , sort of , unique little organisms running around ; we are part of a big ecosystem .
now , we can create bad im@@ p@@ ac@@ ts -- we can po@@ is@@ on ourselves ; we can po@@ is@@ on the earth -- but that &apos;s just a natural outcome of a mistake we made .
now , i &apos;m here largely because there &apos;s kind of a ri@@ ft in dog training at the moment that -- on one side , we have people who think that you train a dog , number one , by making up rules , human rules .
they are just so be@@ at@@ able , and that &apos;s why they get be@@ at@@ en .
no , we go , &quot; pu@@ p@@ p@@ y , sit &quot; -- bo@@ om , it &apos;s got it in six to 10 trials .
they &apos;re like golden re@@ tri@@ e@@ ver@@ s .
and i would say , if it doesn &apos;t have to be , then maybe it shouldn &apos;t be .
not just with their pu@@ p@@ p@@ y , but with the rest of the family at class .
these relationship skills are so easy .
your kids are easy to train .
w@@ k : i wanted to make a win@@ d@@ m@@ il@@ l .
and so , and that win@@ d@@ m@@ il@@ l , what -- it worked ?
w@@ k : yeah . i &apos;m still thinking to work on energy .
because although i &apos;ve used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s very difficult sometimes to make them l@@ y@@ ri@@ cal .
and r@@ ar@@ er still when ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed , as in my case , by self-@@ awareness and a ma@@ st@@ er@@ y of language .
one is a f@@ l@@ as@@ h of white light .
6@@ 4 multi@@ p@@ li@@ ed by 75 .
let &apos;s have a look at the third question .
the desert was ad@@ van@@ cing by a mile or two a year .
hom@@ o er@@ e@@ c@@ tu@@ s made the same tool for 3@@ 0,000 generations .
you can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange -- and indeed there &apos;s re@@ ci@@ pro@@ city in other animals -- but the exchange of one object for another never happens .
that is pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ity , the saving of time in sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fying your needs .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve achieved as a species .
but i &apos;ve got no evidence for that .
and when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were ex@@ changing between groups .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but i &apos;m also sure that , because of the connections people are making , and the ability of ideas to meet and to mate as never before , i &apos;m also sure that technology will ad@@ v@@ ance , and therefore living standards will ad@@ v@@ ance .
that &apos;s as high as a 4@@ 2@@ -@@ story building , and i put the stat@@ u@@ e of li@@ ber@@ ty in there as a scale reference .
and we aren &apos;t talking about it -- we dis@@ miss it .
they &apos;ve gone missing ; these feelings have gone missing .
when people think about making pan@@ -@@ vi@@ ra@@ l detection re@@ ag@@ ents , usually it &apos;s the fa@@ st-@@ e@@ v@@ ol@@ ving problem that &apos;s an issue , because how can we detect things if they &apos;re always changing ?
i talked about that -- you know , that situation where you go into the clinic and you don &apos;t get diagnosed ?
what about real people ?
we se@@ qu@@ en@@ ced part of their viruses ; they &apos;re new r@@ h@@ in@@ o@@ viruses no one &apos;s actually even seen .
she came back after ten days of fe@@ ver , right ? still has the fe@@ ver , and she &apos;s hy@@ po@@ x@@ ic -- she doesn &apos;t have much oxygen in her l@@ un@@ g@@ s .
in fact , it &apos;s not even really se@@ qu@@ en@@ ced that much .
it &apos;s a classic gam@@ ma retro@@ virus , but it &apos;s totally new ; no one &apos;s ever seen it before .
a giant battery could .
instead , let &apos;s invent to the price point of the electricity market .
so i put low-@@ density liquid metal at the top , put a high-@@ density liquid metal at the bottom , and m@@ ol@@ ten s@@ al@@ t in between .
but david &apos;s young and he &apos;s smart and he wants a ph@@ .@@ d@@ . , and he pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ds to build -- he pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ds to build the first ever liquid metal battery of this chemistry .
so what have we learned from all this ?
so this video was taken at a@@ qu@@ ari@@ us under@@ sea laboratory four miles off the coast of key l@@ ar@@ go , about 60 feet below the surface .
so we quickly learned that our gar@@ age was not big enough to hold our growing operation .
but i started getting very interested in mar@@ ia mon@@ t@@ es@@ s@@ or@@ i and her methods , and the way she went about things , and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to kind of discover things on their own rather than being taught these things over@@ t@@ ly .
evolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through , but really it represents this huge set of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to sk@@ i@@ p way ahead here to the space phase .
and our cities are going to be at risk too , because a lot of these are co@@ a@@ st@@ al cities .
but we also have stars and things as well .
so obviously when we think about non@@ ver@@ b@@ al behavior , or body language -- but we call it non@@ ver@@ b@@ als as social scientists -- it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
this expression , which is known as pri@@ de , j@@ es@@ si@@ ca tra@@ cy has studied . she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are con@@ gen@@ it@@ ally blind do this when they win at a physical competition .
so i started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating . is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more ?
so what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really min@@ i@@ ma@@ l level , like this tiny man@@ i@@ pu@@ lation , this tiny inter@@ ven@@ tion ?
so this is in the lab . it &apos;s this little task , you know , it &apos;s just a couple of minutes . where can you actually apply this ? which we car@@ ed about , of course .
these kinds of things . people are bringing their true s@@ el@@ ves , basically . they &apos;re bringing themselves .
and she said , she came in totally de@@ fe@@ ated , and she said , &quot; i &apos;m not supposed to be here . &quot;
they need their bodies , pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y and two minutes , and it can si@@ g@@ ni@@ fi@@ c@@ ant@@ ly change the outcomes of their life .
sal@@ m@@ on swim up@@ stream to get to their sp@@ a@@ w@@ ning gro@@ un@@ ds , and lan@@ c@@ et flu@@ kes com@@ man@@ de@@ er a passing ant , cra@@ w@@ l into its brain , and drive it up a bla@@ de of grass like an all-@@ ter@@ rain vehicle .
and you have to have a bu@@ m@@ p@@ er sti@@ cker , you know . you have to have a statement .
so it is important , i think , to richard , and to me , that these ideas not be ab@@ used and mis@@ used .
and , of course , they &apos;re basically extinct now .
but among all those ideas that ine@@ vi@@ t@@ ably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology , are a lot of toxic ideas .
and , as with ger@@ ms , the trick is not to try to an@@ ni@@ h@@ il@@ ate them .
and in my game , that means you over@@ ge@@ st@@ ic@@ u@@ late .
so we got some shows off the ground . we started t@@ ou@@ r@@ ing them inter@@ na@@ ti@@ on@@ ally .
i know you &apos;re going to say to me , &quot; t doesn &apos;t exist in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d@@ .
no one &apos;s listening . no one &apos;s tru@@ sting .
and you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of su@@ l@@ l@@ en re@@ v@@ ol@@ t .
not to say that it shouldn &apos;t have , but that we have to get better at an@@ s@@ w@@ er@@ ing the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and res@@ po@@ n@@ ses .
they work in government o@@ ff@@ ic@@ es . they &apos;re dri@@ vers .
five dollars can save a life .
she makes about two dollars a day , is creating an education fund , and told me she is not mar@@ r@@ ying nor having children until these things are comp@@ le@@ ted .
finally , in des@@ per@@ ation , they went and they con@@ su@@ l@@ ted a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as the saying goes , when angry , you will make the best speech you will ever regret .
okay , so the great majority of us .
his basic message was un@@ ity too , the inter@@ con@@ ne@@ c@@ te@@ dness of it all , the un@@ ity of it all , and his basic value was respect , was k@@ in@@ dness toward st@@ r@@ an@@ gers .
who fi@@ gh@@ ts while they walk ?
they &apos;ve be@@ gun to walk in israel and pal@@ e@@ st@@ ine , in j@@ or@@ d@@ an , in tur@@ key , in sy@@ ri@@ a .
and so more and more wal@@ kers have come , and l@@ at@@ ely she &apos;s be@@ gun to ear@@ n an income to support her family .
just go up to someone who &apos;s from a different culture , a different country , a different e@@ th@@ ni@@ city , some difference , and engage them in a conversation ; listen to them .
i &apos;m going to start where the story began , 19@@ 8@@ 5 , in central australia .
this morning before you came , who could have had a wash using a sho@@ w@@ er ?
what you see on the screen -- 35 percent of those not@@ -@@ so@@ -@@ famous houses lived in by 50,000 indi@@ gen@@ ous people , 35 percent had a working sho@@ w@@ er .
t@@ w@@ ent@@ y-@@ one percent of the things we fix are due to f@@ au@@ l@@ ty construction , literally things that are built up@@ side down and back@@ -@@ to-@@ front .
we did it . he provided us dust mon@@ it@@ ors .
later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through res@@ p@@ ir@@ atory failure .
the common link between all the work we &apos;ve had to do n@@ el@@ son m@@ and@@ el@@ a said , in the mid-@@ 20@@ 0@@ 0@@ s , not too far from here , he said that like sla@@ very and a@@ par@@ th@@ ei@@ d , &quot; poverty is not natural .
i don &apos;t care if you call me a dy@@ ke . i really don &apos;t .
it actually sounds really ho@@ key to say it standing up here , but when you try to put it in practice , it &apos;s really powerful .
and with that note , i come to you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their communities to live , learn and ear@@ n in a better one .
and that is the yo@@ un@@ g@@ es@@ t na@@ ti@@ on@@ ally c@@ er@@ ti@@ fied work@@ force in america with our br@@ on@@ x bor@@ ou@@ g@@ h president .
that &apos;s a picture i took of my br@@ on@@ x bor@@ ou@@ g@@ h president , ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing my kids in his house , not the ja@@ il@@ house , making them feel a part of it .
so we started giving back .
and most importantly , when you put big kids together with little kids , you get the big fat white guy out of the middle , which is cool , and you create this kind of ac@@ co@@ un@@ t@@ ability amongst pe@@ ers , which is incredible .
now , you may ask about these kids .
keep kids out of stores that look like this .
ste@@ p@@ h@@ en ri@@ t@@ z : a teacher growing green in the south br@@ on@@ x
second of all , i &apos;ll bet even you people who are un@@ trained can see the difference , and we see here an st se@@ g@@ ment el@@ e@@ v@@ ation right after this sharp line .
this pig at 10 : 0@@ 6 was having a heart attack .
the patients who have a mi@@ gra@@ ine pre@@ ce@@ ded by an au@@ ra have a band of excited neurons -- that &apos;s shown in red -- that moves at three to five m@@ il@@ li@@ meters a minute towards the mid-@@ brain .
you see , the problem is , 30 million americans have mi@@ gra@@ ine hea@@ da@@ ches , and we need a means to treat it , and i think that we now have it .
the first wish is to use the e@@ pi@@ le@@ p@@ sy res@@ po@@ n@@ sive neuro@@ st@@ im@@ ul@@ ator , called r@@ ns , for res@@ po@@ n@@ sive neuro@@ st@@ im@@ ul@@ ator -- that &apos;s a brilliant ac@@ r@@ on@@ y@@ m -- for the treatment of other brain disorders .
la@@ w@@ y@@ ers take cases on con@@ tin@@ gen@@ cy with the hope of a big share of a big se@@ tt@@ le@@ ment by a sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic j@@ ur@@ y , because this patient really ended up b@@ ad@@ ly .
a year and a half ago , four of the five people who are full time members at us@@ ha@@ hi@@ d@@ i , which means &quot; te@@ st@@ im@@ on@@ y &quot; in s@@ wa@@ h@@ il@@ i , were ted f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws .
how do you decide what is important ?
so i thought , &quot; i will talk about death . &quot;
i took it out for the first time to come here .
and i &apos;m going to call these people below the bar@@ ri@@ er sh@@ u@@ t-@@ ou@@ ts , because they &apos;re really shut out of the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world .
they &apos;re going to be using con@@ ne@@ x@@ i@@ ons as their platform to develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach in 8@@ 4 countries that are around the world .
right , books that might sell 100 c@@ op@@ ies a year , 1,000 c@@ op@@ ies a year .
it &apos;s no wonder that everybody &apos;s getting into it , right ?
how do we protect it into the future ?
and so that isn &apos;t very hard .
the days of pilot projects are over , when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works . &quot;
well , no , it &apos;s not a laptop project . it &apos;s an education project .
you can serve a couple of thousand kids with two me@@ g@@ ab@@ its .
so it &apos;s sort of an electronic book .
everybody says it &apos;s a $ 100 laptop ; you can &apos;t do it .
and that &apos;s the ro@@ l@@ l@@ out .
they &apos;re cli@@ cking on things and star@@ ing at s@@ cre@@ ens . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , no , no . here &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all &quot; i love lu@@ cy &quot; on a great as@@ se@@ m@@ bly line of information , and we can &apos;t keep up .
thank you .
i think there &apos;s an as@@ su@@ m@@ p@@ tion amongst most people in the public that if a mother is hi@@ v@@ -@@ positive , she &apos;s going to in@@ fe@@ ct her child .
it &apos;s not possible -- it doesn &apos;t work .
you &apos;re going to be okay . you &apos;re going to live .
the first , to prevent mo@@ ther@@ -@@ to-@@ child trans@@ mission .
so , a couple years ago , one of the m@@ ent@@ or mothers came back , and she told me a story .
how do you build a better health care system ?
what &apos;s extraordinary is how simple the pre@@ mis@@ e is .
so if you look at gray matter volume , for example , gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years increases during childhood , which is what you can see on this graph . it pe@@ a@@ ks in early ad@@ ol@@ es@@ c@@ ence .
the very notion of their dad singing in public was enough to make them behave .
here &apos;s the go@@ -@@ k@@ art that we built together .
it was invited , after the first year , by the ars el@@ e@@ c@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ a museum in au@@ stri@@ a to have it in@@ st@@ al@@ l@@ ed in their lo@@ b@@ by , and i &apos;m happy to say it re@@ ma@@ ined online there , 24 hours a day , for almost nine years .
but that night , as we were p@@ ac@@ king up , i asked the t@@ el@@ e-@@ actor , how did the t@@ el@@ e-@@ di@@ re@@ ctors decide that they would give a k@@ is@@ s to sa@@ m don@@ al@@ d@@ son ?
and here &apos;s the result .
it &apos;s a place where my family has been in the sa@@ far@@ i business for four generations .
now , i can tell you , i don &apos;t know what it is about people who grow up looking after cat@@ t@@ le , but it makes for ü@@ b@@ er@@ -@@ res@@ ou@@ r@@ ce@@ f@@ ul@@ ness .
now the first thing that you notice when a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le hits you is the fer@@ o@@ city of the bi@@ te .
he w@@ ra@@ ps it around my leg , pi@@ cks me up a second time , walks me to a vehicle , and he &apos;s able to get me to medical attention .
it was sort of a h@@ ol@@ low in the ground .
and she was like , &quot; well , it &apos;ll be about you . &quot;
well 200 years , we cal@@ cul@@ ated , is at the end of our direct contact with the world .
it &apos;s so easy to think of technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect st@@ or@@ age devices like technology .
she &apos;s the co-@@ cre@@ ator of my 20@@ 0@@ -@@ year plan .
i like to think -- thank you .
and let me tell you , corn is in everything .
i want you to know that there are farmers &apos; markets in every community po@@ pping up .
i led three di@@ ving ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions to ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a .
but tell me where they are and the country that o@@ w@@ ns them . &quot;
and we ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ed the surface of the islands as well -- very important bird ne@@ sting site , some of the most important bi@@ r@@ d-@@ ne@@ sting sites in the pacific , in the world .
we as a world are faced with a problem .
he co@@ ined the term &quot; reverse fishing license . &quot;
of course the de@@ e@@ p@@ -@@ sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine , but the coral , which everybody likes to look at , was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific with large m@@ p@@ as and large conservation z@@ ones on it .
now we have multi@@ -@@ language , in@@ st@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ous , au@@ to@@ matic trans@@ lation services available for free via many of our devices all the way down to s@@ mar@@ t@@ phones .
it &apos;s an end@@ less debate , and there &apos;s no con@@ c@@ lu@@ sive , no single answer to it . but if you &apos;re a ge@@ e@@ k like me , you say , &quot; well , what do the data say ? &quot;
what happened instead is he very carefully do@@ c@@ um@@ ent@@ ed what happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time to an environment and a community .
so there are , of course , two different possibilities .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually an y@@ ves k@@ l@@ ei@@ n painting .
i mean , that &apos;s , at least , how it made me happy .
well , there was a question , of course , that was on my mind for a while : you know , can i do more of the things that i like doing in design and less of the ones that i don &apos;t like to be doing ?
this is from the front .
they face a cru@@ el situation of no choice .
they &apos;re at a big dis@@ advantage in hospitals .
for example , as a 1@@ 5@@ -year-old , i was considered out@@ st@@ and@@ ingly good at multi@@ pl@@ ying numbers because i had me@@ mor@@ ized the multi@@ p@@ li@@ cation t@@ ab@@ les and i know how to use lo@@ g@@ ari@@ th@@ ms and i &apos;m quick at man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ating a slide rule .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s , 70s , 80s and 9@@ 0@@ s , who are still active as investment man@@ a@@ gers , farmers , la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and doctors .
as ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an i@@ con@@ o@@ graphy got changed , and s@@ wa@@ sti@@ k@@ as were created out of cru@@ ci@@ fi@@ x@@ es , bat@@ man and super@@ man were created by jewish young men in the united states and canada , also going back to the bible .
the first is the fall of gr@@ an@@ ad@@ a , the last muslim en@@ c@@ la@@ ve in europe .
now the main bad guy , ru@@ g@@ ha@@ l , does not want these stones to up@@ date , so he &apos;s trying to get them to stop up@@ d@@ at@@ ing .
and this is one of my fa@@ v@@ or@@ ites , al-@@ bat@@ in@@ a from ye@@ men .
&quot; so when &apos;s the article coming out ? &quot;
ru@@ g@@ ha@@ l : there must be something we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group self-@@ i@@ den@@ ti@@ fi@@ es itself as extreme .

let &apos;s take a look .
let me hi@@ gh@@ light it for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing , i discovered an odd thing about myself .
so , you have the eye , and then you drop in the concepts .
but of course , china has an enormous population .
but what it points to is that vis@@ u@@ ali@@ zing information like this is a form of knowledge comp@@ res@@ sion .
it &apos;s even fun to engage with them because it &apos;s visual .
the e@@ den top note is named after the e@@ den project in the u.k.
why doesn &apos;t it smell of po@@ t@@ at@@ o@@ es or vi@@ o@@ lets ? well , there are really two the@@ or@@ ies .
a theory is something that en@@ ab@@ les you to do less work .
now , after searching high and low for several months , i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a bor@@ an@@ e which has exactly the same vi@@ bra@@ tion .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
they made it ... and it s@@ m@@ elled exactly like c@@ ou@@ mar@@ in .
this is a real thing .
there are a couple of things going on right now that i want to bring to your attention .
and she sort of , she had no idea of the context in which she &apos;d landed .
nor@@ man !
i didn &apos;t say go@@ o@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ e to anybody , not my mother , my father , my si@@ sters , my brothers , my a@@ un@@ ts , my un@@ c@@ les , my c@@ ou@@ s@@ ins , my grand@@ parents , nobody .
i &apos;m re@@ por@@ ting back . i &apos;m re@@ por@@ ting back simply to say that when i left the children &apos;s home i had two things that i wanted to do . one was to find my family , and the other was to write poetry .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you .
he had a s@@ co@@ li@@ o@@ sis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female , and probably much smaller , members of his family group , to have got to where he did in life , age 12 .
is this a good evolutionary a@@ da@@ p@@ tation , or is it going to lead us to being the sh@@ or@@ te@@ st-@@ lived hom@@ in@@ id species on planet earth ?
but will we do that , or will we just let nature take its course ?
and one day , a couple of weeks later , it might have been maybe a year later , i was in the art store with my kids , and i was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a cra@@ ft day .
and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me .
my pre@@ fer@@ ence is about 70 co@@ ats of this -- ma@@ t@@ te black au@@ to pri@@ m@@ er .
you want to know how obsessed i am . this project &apos;s only for me , and yet i went so far as to buy on e@@ bay a 19@@ 4@@ 1 chinese san f@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ is@@ co-@@ based newspaper , in order so that the bird could properly be w@@ ra@@ pped ...
as we made our way up towards the spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ ul@@ ar blue mountains west of sy@@ d@@ ne@@ y , it was the perfect au@@ tu@@ m@@ n day : s@@ uns@@ h@@ ine , the smell of eu@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ t and a dream .
&quot; no . it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you walk again , it will be with c@@ ali@@ pers and a walking frame . &quot;
i remember dad pushing me outside in my wh@@ e@@ el@@ chair , w@@ ra@@ pped in a pla@@ ster body cast , and feeling the sun on my face for the first time .
they told me , &quot; we &apos;re going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her . &quot;
she passed me the phone book , i ran@@ g up the flying school , i made a bo@@ o@@ king , said i &apos;d like to make a bo@@ o@@ king to come out for a flight .
and i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
and mom and dad ? never been up .
i &apos;m in that world , but i work pur@@ ely in@@ st@@ in@@ c@@ tively .
that is like an an@@ ish ka@@ poor flo@@ wing through a richard ser@@ ra .
how the hell do i do a telephone in three weeks , when you get these things that take hundreds of million years to evolve ?
any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object .
in his day , he was the highest ta@@ x@@ pa@@ yer in britain .
i &apos;m looking at s@@ ing@@ le-@@ surface structures and how they flow -- how they st@@ re@@ t@@ ch and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture t@@ y@@ po@@ lo@@ gi@@ es , but that &apos;s not the end motivation . it &apos;s made from al@@ um@@ in@@ um , as opposed to al@@ um@@ in@@ i@@ um , and it &apos;s grown .
that &apos;s the car of the future . it &apos;s a water dro@@ p@@ let .
if you put it next to con@@ te@@ m@@ por@@ ary architecture , it feels totally natural to me .
that &apos;s my studio . it &apos;s sub@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an .
it &apos;s made from k@@ e@@ v@@ l@@ ar .
right after i comp@@ le@@ ted my ph@@ .@@ d@@ . , i was lucky enough to be in@@ c@@ lu@@ ded with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration .
there was another one of those com@@ b j@@ el@@ li@@ es .
so it uses its red bi@@ ol@@ um@@ in@@ es@@ c@@ ence like a s@@ ni@@ per &apos;s sc@@ op@@ e to be able to s@@ ne@@ ak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen .
so they can use it for finding food , for at@@ tra@@ cting ma@@ tes .
and i de@@ fy you to name any other br@@ an@@ ch of science that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology .
it &apos;s a ma@@ gi@@ cal place .
and i began the journey of re@@ dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ing the value of sleep .
and it was on june 5 , 19@@ 9@@ 5 , that i heard a loud bang against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a du@@ ck .
and here are the du@@ cks again .
after winning this prize , my life changed .
another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds .
so , for example , if i have , like — this is the sound of pur@@ p@@ le .
so depending on how i display it , i can hear and i can com@@ pos@@ e music with food .
one of them is martin lu@@ ther king &apos;s &quot; i have a dream , &quot; and the other one is h@@ it@@ ler .
indeed , there is this phenomenon now where the general co@@ un@@ s@@ el@@ s are becoming the ce@@ os .
you wouldn &apos;t want to say something o@@ ff@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ cu@@ ff that might be used against you . &quot;
absolutely vital .
and what happens when the teacher tries to as@@ s@@ er@@ t order ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t they trust the law ?
it turns out that freedom actually has a for@@ ma@@ l structure .
because life is complex , and here is the har@@ des@@ t and biggest change : we have to re@@ store the authority to ju@@ d@@ ges and o@@ ff@@ i@@ ci@@ als to inter@@ pre@@ t and apply the law .
a free society requires red lights and green lights , otherwise it soon des@@ c@@ ends into gri@@ d@@ lo@@ ck .
im@@ pos@@ e limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fe@@ es .
well if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to measure out round col@@ um@@ ns using a r@@ ul@@ er .
he had a pretty low-@@ wa@@ ge job .
he did after all have a to@@ y gun .
but the problem with rel@@ ying on rules and incentives is that they de@@ mor@@ alize professional activity , and they de@@ mor@@ alize professional activity in two senses .
so can@@ ny out@@ laws are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine any can@@ ny out@@ law su@@ sta@@ in@@ ing that for an in@@ de@@ fin@@ i@@ te period of time .
why has the idea spread ?
people want to be allowed to be vi@@ r@@ tu@@ ous .
and it was an extraordinary time , and i am going to go through some of the m@@ ent@@ ality that we -- that americans and the rest of the world were ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ cing .
this was b@@ er@@ t the tur@@ t@@ le .
the main point here is we were dealing with a complete dis@@ connect from reality .
so , what i &apos;d like to show you is what it would take to hold 75 pounds of highly en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um .
what if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon ?
we &apos;re coming down , and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here , in the financial di@@ stri@@ ct .
part of the problem is that the emergency pl@@ an@@ ners themselves , personally , are over@@ wh@@ el@@ med p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ol@@ o@@ gi@@ cally by the thought of nuclear cat@@ a@@ st@@ ro@@ p@@ he .
this was sent to me by somebody who is an a@@ fi@@ ci@@ on@@ a@@ do of civil defense pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ur@@ es , but the fact of the matter is that america &apos;s gone through a very hard time .
there &apos;s a lot of bad ac@@ t@@ ors out there that have done the wrong thing , that actually have made the problem worse .
we can show results . we can make things better .
how do we ta@@ p into this ?
it &apos;s pro@@ f@@ it@@ able to have an un@@ safe working environment .
imagine if we could do that , because if we could do it , we could scale .
the governments that are making the most progress are the governments that have found ways to enable shared value in business rather than see government as the only player that has to call the sh@@ ots .
maybe i can cut there , see the brain , and i can change my cut .
let me zoom in .
i &apos;d like you to come back with me for a moment to the 19th century , specifically to june 24 , 18@@ 3@@ 3 .
i &apos;m sure we could all be that productive without facebook or twitter to take up our time .
they also rel@@ ent@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ly lo@@ b@@ bi@@ ed the british government for the money to build b@@ ab@@ b@@ age &apos;s en@@ g@@ ines because they believed these en@@ g@@ ines would have a huge practical impact on society .
these gr@@ ants not only allowed less we@@ al@@ th@@ y men to con@@ du@@ ct research , but they also en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ ged thinking outside the box , rather than just trying to solve one pre-@@ set question .
i &apos;m going to tell you about how i learned something about life .
so once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things -- so this particular person wrote a whole article and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and for those of you who aren &apos;t old enough , you have no idea how this in@@ fe@@ ction was working -- n@@ am@@ ely , through these flo@@ p@@ p@@ y dis@@ ks .
there &apos;s about 10,000 programs sitting here .
so here would be a frequency plot of how often you find each of the 26 letters of the al@@ p@@ h@@ ab@@ et in a text written by random monkeys .
anywhere there &apos;s life , you &apos;re going to have this distribution , as opposed to that distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the co@@ p says , &quot; are you sure ? hey bu@@ d@@ dy , are you sure you lost your ke@@ ys here ? &quot;
this is the data from a single v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ ation co@@ ver@@ age survey in a single di@@ stri@@ ct in the country of z@@ am@@ bi@@ a from a few years ago that i par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in .
as you can see , br@@ u@@ ce wi@@ l@@ li@@ s had a lot more hair back then .
so you could be talking about 10,000 or 20,000 or 3@@ 0,000 dollars if i actually had the time or it fit my s@@ ch@@ e@@ du@@ le and i wasn &apos;t on v@@ ac@@ ation .
instead of training people how to put forms onto mobile devices , let &apos;s create software that lets them do it themselves with no training and without me being involved ?
that &apos;s less than i used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a con@@ su@@ l@@ tation .
so , then , we understand that if we want to change our tra@@ je@@ ct@@ ory , in life , or in the balloon , we have to change al@@ ti@@ tu@@ de .
this can be in sp@@ i@@ ri@@ tu@@ ality .
and this is why you need wea@@ ther@@ men .
i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world , it would be with no fuel , independent from fossil en@@ er@@ gi@@ es , in order to be safe , not to be th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed by the fuel g@@ au@@ ge .
i think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties , that can talk to students , talk to politicians during the flight , and really make it a human ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure .
and what &apos;s the goal now ?
this is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team .
now , you need a laptop .
anyway , we found africa to be a ma@@ gi@@ cal place .
the next thing i &apos;d like to be clear about is what this problem is , and what this problem isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s crazy , really , when you think about it .
and let &apos;s cut the cra@@ p for a second .
the fact is that ours is the first generation that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye , look across the ocean to africa , and say this , and mean it : we do not have to stand for this .
it is a pain in the ar@@ se .
this year is a test for us all , especially the leaders of the g@@ 8 nations , who really are on the line here , with all the world in history watching .
people are starting to figure this out .
and with this one campaign as our um@@ br@@ ell@@ a , my organization , data , and other groups , have been ta@@ pping into the energy and the en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ as@@ m that &apos;s out there from hollywood into the he@@ ar@@ t@@ land of america .
: one by one they step forward , a nurse , a teacher , a hom@@ e@@ ma@@ ker , and lives are saved .
the idea that the internet , which changed all of our lives , can transform a country -- and a continent that has hardly made it to an@@ al@@ o@@ g , let alone digital -- b@@ lo@@ ws my mind .
li@@ ps are not li@@ ps , but v@@ ol@@ can@@ o@@ es .
what you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called b@@ ou@@ b@@ a , and which is called ki@@ k@@ i .
now , unless you &apos;re a prison gu@@ ard , the sentence &quot; some jobs are ja@@ ils &quot; is literally false .
whenever we solve a problem , or make a discovery , we compare what we know with what we don &apos;t know .
na@@ di@@ a al-@@ sa@@ k@@ ka@@ f : well , i &apos;m g@@ la@@ d to be here .
and yet , you yourself de@@ fy all those char@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ z@@ a@@ tions .
p@@ m : i don &apos;t think so .
so how have you de@@ al@@ t with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you ?
some of my re@@ por@@ ters were ar@@ re@@ sted .
and it definitely does give a different image of ye@@ men .
my heart was three-@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ half si@@ zes too big .
this is a list of the side effects : if you eat too much s@@ al@@ t , like a pe@@ an@@ u@@ t bu@@ t@@ ter and j@@ el@@ ly s@@ and@@ wi@@ ch , you &apos;ll probably end up in the ic@@ u .
but soon i was showing signs of ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ heart failure , and i had to return to sea level , doing so knowing that i probably would never see my home again .
i was sitting there kind of un@@ en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ a@@ st@@ ically talking with the head tr@@ an@@ sp@@ l@@ ant surgeon , and i asked him if i needed a tr@@ an@@ sp@@ l@@ ant , what i could do to pre@@ p@@ are .
i was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive .
thank you .
interestingly , one of those birth de@@ fe@@ cts has seen a 200 percent increase in the u.s.
what &apos;s interesting is , in fact , the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of at@@ ra@@ z@@ ine , the breast cancer pro@@ m@@ ot@@ er , now s@@ ell@@ s us the b@@ lo@@ cker -- the exact same company .
but we also start out as a@@ qu@@ a@@ tic organisms .
what would our un@@ born children say to us when they have an ex@@ pos@@ ure today , i had some o@@ ct@@ y@@ ph@@ en@@ ol@@ s , some artificial m@@ us@@ ks and some bis@@ ph@@ en@@ ol a@@ .
the problem is , in my village , o@@ a@@ k@@ l@@ and , in most of our villages , we don &apos;t see that connection .
here is the ac@@ cu@@ mu@@ lation at bi@@ on@@ a cre@@ e@@ k next to the l@@ .@@ a@@ . airport .
i offered five cents each for bottle cap@@ s .
the th@@ ro@@ wa@@ way society cannot be con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed -- it has gone global .
you can see the range of the coast re@@ d@@ wo@@ o@@ ds . it &apos;s here , in red .
you &apos;re like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant , and most of the organism is over@@ head , un@@ seen .
looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing bi@@ r@@ d@@ song coming in three dimensions around us .
re@@ d@@ wo@@ o@@ ds have an enormous surface area that ex@@ ten@@ ds up@@ ward into space because they have a pro@@ pen@@ si@@ ty to do something called r@@ ei@@ ter@@ ation .
flying bu@@ t@@ tr@@ es@@ s@@ es , just as in a ca@@ the@@ d@@ ra@@ l , help st@@ r@@ en@@ g@@ then the cro@@ wn of the tree and help the tree exist longer through time .
it &apos;s absolutely he@@ ar@@ t@@ breaking to see .
but l@@ at@@ ely , the do@@ ors of the pal@@ ac@@ e have been fl@@ un@@ g open , and the walls are coming down .
that &apos;s 25 years ago .
for example , let &apos;s go with the c@@ en@@ ti@@ pe@@ de virus first .
so how do these guys then mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ze those infected computers ?
and they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security pre@@ c@@ au@@ tions we can build .
you &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a web address : uni@@ on@@ se@@ e@@ k@@ .com / d / i@@ o@@ o@@ .@@ ex@@ e and when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to down@@ load and run that program .
and if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the mer@@ ce@@ des is o@@ 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ko@@ 7@@ 8@@ ru@@ s .
we must have some way of con@@ tin@@ u@@ ing to work even if computers fail .
but i &apos;m not engaged in doing that .
that person sur@@ ro@@ un@@ ds himself or herself with ad@@ vis@@ ers .
why should we believe what he &apos;s saying ? &quot;
what &apos;s its future ?
that power dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ars completely ; nobody su@@ p@@ por@@ ts that by 20@@ 11 .
it would be a good thing if people paid more attention , took seriously , and engaged in the same sorts of cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions , because it would change things . but it would change things in two ben@@ e@@ fi@@ ci@@ al ways .
this means that we can identify a match even if the copy used is just a por@@ tion of the original fi@@ le , plays it in slow motion and has de@@ gra@@ ded au@@ di@@ o and video quality .
and j@@ il@@ l and k@@ e@@ v@@ in , the happy couple , they came back from their h@@ on@@ e@@ y@@ moon and found that their video had gone crazy vi@@ ra@@ l .
thank you .
you will go far away .
it &apos;s what he had been trained to do since he was five years old .
i am gr@@ at@@ e@@ ful for the fact that i had a m@@ ent@@ or like ma@@ u who taught me how to na@@ vi@@ gate .
what is it that drives you in your life today ? not 10 years ago .
how do you take what you &apos;re d@@ re@@ am@@ ing of and make it happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right man@@ ag@@ er . didn &apos;t have the ...
in this second , con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously or un@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously , the minute you decide to focus on something you &apos;ve got to give it a meaning , and whatever that meaning is produces emotion .
have you ever done something , after you did it , you go , &quot; that was me ! &quot;
bor@@ ed out of your minds . so , god , in her infinite wisdom , gave us a second human need , which is un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s true -- we need it . we can do it through in@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy , through fri@@ end@@ ship , through pra@@ yer , through walking in nature .
and there are seven different be@@ li@@ e@@ f@@ s . i can &apos;t go through them because i &apos;m done . the last piece is emotion .
jewish man with family in the oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ ed ter@@ ri@@ t@@ ory , someone in new york who would have died if he was at work that day , and this man who wanted to be a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist and made it very clear .
instead , i &apos;m really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories , people all around the world .
the color of each particle cor@@ res@@ po@@ n@@ ds to the type of feeling inside -- so that happy , positive feelings are bri@@ gh@@ t@@ ly col@@ or@@ ed .
we see , &quot; i feel like i have been at a computer all day . &quot;
and then if i go over here , the list begins to sc@@ roll , and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected .
the ten the@@ m@@ es radi@@ ate out and orbit the time cap@@ su@@ le .
it &apos;s called universe : re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing our modern my@@ th@@ ology .
we can click on this and we see this i@@ con@@ ic image of be@@ tt@@ y ford k@@ is@@ sing her husband &apos;s co@@ ff@@ in .
and there are also qu@@ ot@@ es that you can see , if you &apos;re interested in reading about qu@@ ot@@ es on climate change .
and so people think of clouds as things that get in the way .
tens of thousands of members now in almost 100 countries around the world .
you just need to step outside , pay attention to what &apos;s so com@@ mon@@ place , so everyday , so m@@ und@@ an@@ e that everybody else mis@@ ses it .
so keep looking up , mar@@ v@@ el at the e@@ p@@ he@@ mer@@ al beauty , and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds .
they would put up 2@@ 5,000 images , they would go like this , &quot; 2@@ 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 , okay , okay .
and you know , going back maybe 10 years in time when i got the funding to buy my first graphics computer -- it was a huge machine .
so this is from a virtual au@@ t@@ op@@ sy .
here you can see that k@@ ni@@ f@@ e went through the heart .
it &apos;s a little mechanical pen that has very , very fast step m@@ ot@@ ors inside of the pen .
now this is really an interesting project .
so he &apos;s going like this .
so , some very t@@ al@@ ent@@ ed people .
i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible , to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world .
so it &apos;s not the final story , but it &apos;s an incredibly powerful su@@ m@@ mar@@ y of everything we know about nature at the most basic level .
i won &apos;t go into the details of why we think the universe is like this , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .
as i pur@@ su@@ ed my career , something was always g@@ na@@ wing away inside me .
and in 2001 , i took a research leave to visit them .
and we got lots of app@@ li@@ can@@ ts .
so here is where we were after the first gra@@ du@@ ation in 2004 .
he &apos;s about to finish his ph@@ .@@ d@@ . , and he was fil@@ med recently with someone you all know .
each will have a pan@@ -@@ african student body , but speci@@ alize in a different area of science .
i got my first computer when i was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er growing up in ac@@ cr@@ a , and it was a really cool device .
he studies the brain using m@@ r@@ i , and he c@@ la@@ im@@ s that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever sc@@ an@@ ned .
and i &apos;ll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides .
tr@@ an@@ si@@ st@@ or@@ s are getting smaller to allow this to happen , and technology has really ben@@ e@@ f@@ it@@ ted from that .
the re@@ tin@@ a chip that we designed si@@ ts behind this lens here .
and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it .
so , in that sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so , now we know what a s@@ ch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ ch@@ il@@ d radi@@ us is .
i like to call these the pri@@ ma don@@ na of the galaxy world , because they are kind of show o@@ ff@@ s .
so , we can see far more detail in our galaxy than an@@ y@@ place else .
and that bu@@ ys us about a factor of 20 .
so , there was actually lots of al@@ ter@@ na@@ ti@@ ves to the idea that there was a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff in there .
it p@@ ul@@ ls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stri@@ pped apart .
and i hope , if nothing else , i &apos;ve convinced you that , one , we do in fact have a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
one day in new york , i was on the street and i saw some kids playing bas@@ e@@ ball between sto@@ op@@ s and cars and fire hy@@ dr@@ ants .
so for example , in the 1@@ 1@@ th century , people liked pieces that ended like this .
so in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big &apos; what &apos; was to pra@@ ise god .
and new and im@@ pro@@ ved instruments made the age of the vi@@ r@@ tu@@ o@@ so possible .
the question remains : what happens when the music st@@ op@@ s ?
michael ti@@ l@@ son thomas : music and emotion through time
so this is the da@@ wn of the new age of k@@ it@@ es .
by 19@@ 45 , they were making 100,000 .
so , i &apos;ll talk about musical com@@ position , even though i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er , y@@ a@@ y !
but recently , i &apos;ve become in@@ tri@@ gu@@ ed by a different way of thinking of large human cro@@ w@@ ds , because there are circumstances where they can do something really cool .
well , i think it &apos;s the latest i@@ ter@@ ation of a phenomenon we can call &quot; cro@@ w@@ d-@@ ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ ated innovation . &quot;
but the desire element is really di@@ al@@ ed way up .
we &apos;re getting great talks back from them .
here , let me introduce you to sa@@ m h@@ ab@@ er .
but even leaving the screen out of it , there &apos;s still a lot more being trans@@ fer@@ red than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s actually happening right now .
how web video powers global innovation
first of all , i must , as a speaker , provide a service to the audience and talk about what i will give you , instead of saying what i can &apos;t have .
i hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible te@@ d@@ talks .
well , you can &apos;t compare or@@ an@@ ges to win@@ d@@ shi@@ el@@ ds .
they keep you alive . it gives them the p@@ ie , it gives that kind of a behavioral pun@@ ch which we &apos;ve called a super@@ power .
these kinds of pro@@ b@@ es explo@@ it it . okay ?
and someone asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
thought he could turn back the waves ; couldn &apos;t turn back the waves .
well , i think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference : in transparency , in greater choice and in ac@@ co@@ un@@ t@@ ability , in giving us that gen@@ u@@ ine people power .
how do you do it ?
my bridge co@@ a@@ ch , sh@@ ar@@ on o@@ s@@ berg , says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else &apos;s in the world .
el@@ even out of 14 .
and second , teachers in the program told us that these videos and these sur@@ ve@@ ys from the students were very h@@ el@@ p@@ ful di@@ ag@@ no@@ stic tools , because they pointed to specific places where they can improve .
al@@ ri@@ gh@@ ty , everybody , have a great we@@ e@@ k@@ end .
reading and writing dna code is getting easier and cheaper .
bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers work alone .
now , you might be asking yourself , &quot; well , you know , what would i do in a bi@@ ol@@ a@@ b ? &quot;
if you had spaces like this all over the world , it could really change the perception of who &apos;s allowed to do bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch .
the kingdom ar@@ gu@@ es that its laws allow it to de@@ ta@@ in or de@@ por@@ t for@@ ei@@ g@@ ners who pos@@ e a risk to the economy or the security or the public health or the mor@@ als of the state .
these laws fly in the face of science , and they are gro@@ und@@ ed in pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and in ig@@ nor@@ ance and in a re@@ writing of tradition and a s@@ el@@ e@@ ctive reading of religion .
why are you pregnant when you are living positive ? &quot;
in fact , one in every 10 new in@@ fe@@ ctions of hiv is among people who in@@ je@@ ct drugs .
so for example , ou@@ tre@@ a@@ ch workers who are di@@ stri@@ bu@@ ting con@@ d@@ om@@ s to vulnerable populations are not themselves subject to police har@@ as@@ s@@ ment or ab@@ use or ar@@ b@@ it@@ r@@ ary ar@@ rest .
that &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
the office building is basically ob@@ so@@ le@@ te for doing private work .
they took the el@@ e@@ v@@ ated highway , they got rid of it , they re@@ c@@ la@@ im@@ ed the street , the river down below , below the street , and you can go from one end of se@@ ou@@ l to the other without crossing a pa@@ th@@ way for cars .
people say , we don &apos;t really want to live in a little te@@ en@@ y conventional apartment .
we think work@@ places should be shared .
you get g@@ al@@ l@@ ons of oil from their liver .
and they killed about 1@@ 2@@ ,000 sharks in this period , literally just by st@@ r@@ ing@@ ing a man@@ il@@ a ro@@ p@@ e off the ti@@ p of ke@@ em bay at a@@ ch@@ il@@ l island .
we know very little about them .
so this tag actually works out the lo@@ ca@@ tions of shark depending on the ti@@ m@@ ing and the setting of the sun , plus water temperature and de@@ p@@ th .
if you look at nu@@ c@@ le@@ o@@ ti@@ de diversity , which is more gen@@ e@@ tics that are passed on through parents , you can see that bas@@ king sharks , if you look at the first study , was an order of ma@@ g@@ ni@@ tu@@ de less diversity than other shark species .
so les did a fin@@ er study and he found out it came out about 9@@ ,000 .
and that was fine . we got we@@ t . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , you know , i can build on this . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it , we can tell the gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ist this was taken from a male or a female .
so i decided to go there and act as a s@@ ell@@ er .
their bodies are ch@@ op@@ p@@ ed up with ma@@ ch@@ et@@ es and are supposed to be used for some con@@ co@@ ctions or some po@@ tions for people to get money -- or so many , many stories people would tell about it .
i have not done any business with anybody .
my kind of j@@ ou@@ r@@ n@@ alism might not fit in other con@@ tin@@ ents or other countries , but i can tell you , it works in my part of the continent of africa , because usually , when people talk about corruption , they ask , &quot; where is the evidence ?
a@@ a thank you .
i was raised in down@@ town manhattan in the early 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , two blocks from the e@@ p@@ ic@@ enter of pun@@ k music .
i wouldn &apos;t have qu@@ ali@@ fied as trans@@ gender .
and had these people ever even con@@ s@@ ci@@ ously met a vi@@ c@@ ti@@ m of their dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation ?
today in 2@@ 9 states , more than half of this country , you can le@@ g@@ ally be fi@@ red just for your se@@ x@@ u@@ ality .
at some point i realized that my mission to photograph &quot; ga@@ ys &quot; was in@@ her@@ ently fla@@ wed , because there were a million different sha@@ des of gay .
at the very least i hope it makes it harder to den@@ y their human rights .
one , the world is , was , will always be filled with good and evil , because good and evil is the y@@ in and y@@ an@@ g of the human condition .
and th@@ ir@@ dly , i had access to all of the 1,000 pictures that these soldiers took .
there are three ways . the main way is -- it &apos;s called dis@@ pos@@ i@@ tional .
this is st@@ an@@ ley m@@ il@@ gram , little jewish kid from the br@@ on@@ x , and he asked the question , &quot; could the h@@ ol@@ o@@ c@@ au@@ st happen here , now ? &quot;
&quot; sir , who &apos;s going to be responsible if something happens to him ? &quot;
interestingly , st@@ an@@ ley m@@ il@@ gram and i were in the same high school class in james mon@@ ro@@ e in the br@@ on@@ x , 19@@ 5@@ 4 .
here are the gu@@ ar@@ ds with the symbols of power and an@@ on@@ y@@ m@@ ity .
de@@ hu@@ man@@ i@@ zation of others . de@@ -@@ indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ation of self .
al@@ e@@ k@@ s@@ and@@ r sol@@ z@@ h@@ en@@ it@@ sy@@ n says , &quot; the line between good and evil cu@@ ts through the heart of every human being . &quot;
and i ended the study the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what anyone could do , &quot; no big deal to jump on the tra@@ cks .
this is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to el@@ u@@ ci@@ date .
we have s@@ el@@ ves .
but on my left re@@ tin@@ a there is a bu@@ m@@ p , which is mar@@ ked there by the red ar@@ row .
there is just one reference point , which is the body .
i promise not to say anything about this , except this is to fri@@ gh@@ ten you .
and the au@@ to@@ bio@@ gra@@ p@@ hi@@ cal self has pro@@ m@@ p@@ ted ex@@ ten@@ ded memory , re@@ as@@ on@@ ing , imagination , creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for hi@@ p@@ -@@ ho@@ p -- and an@@ it@@ a hill .
now i tell you this -- i tell you this at the risk of em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sing myself , because i think part of the work of fe@@ min@@ ism is to admit that a@@ es@@ the@@ tics , that beauty , that fun do matter .
we don &apos;t want one hero .
you may have gu@@ es@@ s@@ ed by now , i did not light myself on fire .
she was talking about board meetings , she was fo@@ und@@ ing peace organizations , she was co@@ or@@ din@@ ating car@@ po@@ ol@@ s , she was con@@ sol@@ ing friends -- all these daily acts of care and creativity .
i mean , it &apos;s self-@@ awareness that se@@ par@@ ates hom@@ o sa@@ pi@@ ens from earlier in@@ st@@ an@@ ces of our man@@ kind .
this is actually a bra@@ in@@ wave sen@@ s@@ or that &apos;s reading the electrical activity of my brain as i give this talk .
we brought to life a vast ar@@ ray of pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es and products that you could control with your mind , like th@@ ou@@ gh@@ t-@@ controlled home app@@ li@@ ances or a le@@ vi@@ t@@ at@@ ing chair .
the head@@ set con@@ ne@@ cts wi@@ r@@ el@@ es@@ s@@ ly to an i@@ pa@@ d or a s@@ mar@@ t@@ phone .
the way these children will be able to use their new awareness to improve themselves will up@@ end many of the da@@ ma@@ ging and wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad social st@@ ig@@ m@@ as that people who are diagnosed as different are ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ged with .
they understood the power of human narrative and the value that we place on humans as changing , e@@ v@@ ol@@ ving and growing .
and he said , &quot; so what are you going to do to celebrate ? &quot;
my ability and my potential .
and te@@ m@@ por@@ ari@@ ly , very un@@ ex@@ pe@@ c@@ te@@ dly , they dropped .
and that eye speci@@ al@@ ist , he didn &apos;t bo@@ ther testing my eyes .
and i went on a run that i know so well .
and really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened .
because i wasn &apos;t be@@ li@@ e@@ ving in me , really me , all the bits of me -- all the bits of all of us .
this is me , all of me .
what we have is exactly the same thing , the same activity , but one of them makes you feel great and the other one , with just a small change of post@@ ure , makes you feel terrible .
but i think there &apos;s another debate to be asked , which is the level of control we have over our tax money .
for 0.@@ 0@@ 1 percent of this money you could have put wi@@ f@@ i on the tra@@ ins , which wouldn &apos;t have reduced the du@@ ration of the journey , but would have im@@ pro@@ ved its en@@ jo@@ y@@ ment and its u@@ se@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ ness far more .
i &apos;m not asking for the complete pri@@ ma@@ cy of one over the other .
sometimes you get very , very severe qu@@ eu@@ es .
i think the danger we have in today &apos;s world is we have the study of economics con@@ si@@ ders itself to be a pri@@ or dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine to the study of human psychology .
the average answer , or the mo@@ d@@ al answer would have been 50 to 60 percent .
tru@@ sted not to hurt themselves , and tru@@ sted not to hurt others .
y@@ a@@ y !
these are stories from 20 , 30 years ago .
but that wouldn &apos;t mean that i had a two-@@ headed co@@ in .
and this is not a difficult problem to fix .
but this our con@@ ta@@ in@@ ment of the visible universe .
thank you .
we &apos;ve had good enough , really , very powerful effects with kids around the world , and now people of all ages , using hy@@ per@@ score .
and it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , who wants to live forever .
dan ell@@ se@@ y : hello . my name is dan ell@@ se@@ y . i am 3@@ 4 years old and i have c@@ er@@ e@@ bra@@ l pal@@ sy .
in fact , this is the score for dan &apos;s piece , completely com@@ pos@@ ed by dan in hy@@ per@@ score .
o@@ dy@@ s@@ se@@ us would have said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s do a dry run .
there is first , the present self .
i had to write five pages a day towards papers or i would have to give up five dollars .
and so there &apos;s no way that this is going to work . &quot;
and i &apos;ll show you some of these tools right here .
the last thing i &apos;ll show you , the last behavioral time machine , is something that i created with ha@@ l her@@ sh@@ field , who was introduced to me by my co@@ author on a previous project , bill sh@@ ar@@ pe .
and what &apos;s nice about it is it &apos;s not something that bi@@ as@@ ing people actually , because as one face s@@ miles , the other face f@@ ro@@ w@@ ns .
that &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the common era by the per@@ si@@ ans and the ar@@ ab@@ s and the tur@@ ks .
x is the unknown because you can &apos;t say &quot; s@@ h &quot; in sp@@ an@@ ish .
it isn &apos;t surprising , then , that if you should speak to anyone affected by a mental illness , the chan@@ ces are that you will hear stories of hidden suffering , shame and dis@@ cri@@ min@@ ation in nearly every sector of their lives .
just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world as@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ ed at al@@ ma@@ -@@ at@@ a and made this i@@ con@@ ic de@@ c@@ l@@ ar@@ ation .
what is this about ?
and if you look at the species level , you saw about fish .
but of course , if you look at exactly what those pro@@ f@@ its are , almost 8@@ ,000 of those dollars are , in fact , sub@@ si@@ dies .
that was in the early 20@@ 0@@ 0@@ s when india was going g@@ un@@ g@@ -@@ h@@ o about gdp growth as the means forward -- looking at china with its st@@ ell@@ ar gro@@ w@@ ths of eight , nine , 10 percent and wondering , why can we do the same ?
now that &apos;s not a happy situation for them , but they have the confidence and the courage to come forward and say , &quot; here &apos;s what we are measuring .
green carbon , which is the de@@ for@@ e@@ st@@ ation and agricultural emissions , and blue carbon together com@@ pr@@ ise 25 percent of our emissions .
richard fe@@ y@@ n@@ man was a very complex man .
he loved to win .
i didn &apos;t know what those things meant , neither did di@@ ck -- neither did sy@@ d@@ ne@@ y for that matter .
i also liked the kind of intellectual ma@@ ch@@ o games .
and he said he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again in 19@@ 6@@ 8 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move during the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they &apos;re moving .
we stri@@ pped out all the v@@ in@@ y@@ l and z@@ ol@@ at@@ one paint that was co@@ ver@@ ing up this just fantastic al@@ um@@ in@@ um shell .
a lot of these ideas mi@@ gr@@ ated into the production tra@@ il@@ ers for air@@ stream .
so if you &apos;re thinking about sending your kid to tin@@ k@@ er@@ ing school , they do come back br@@ u@@ is@@ ed , sc@@ ra@@ ped and b@@ lo@@ o@@ dy .
you know , let them fo@@ ol around with it on their own terms and trust me , they &apos;re going to learn things that you can &apos;t get out of playing with dor@@ a the ex@@ pl@@ or@@ er to@@ ys .
next time you &apos;re about to throw out an app@@ li@@ ance , don &apos;t throw it out .
i think that &apos;s it . that &apos;s number five and a half . ok .
so here &apos;s my wife &apos;s bad knee on the left , and her just hi@@ king now four months later in as@@ pen , and doing well .
what about getting to a total bi@@ ol@@ o@@ gi@@ c knee re@@ pl@@ ac@@ em@@ ent , not just the parts ?
this is one of the seven sur@@ vi@@ ving sp@@ u@@ t@@ ni@@ ks that was not launched into space .
and so all of western europe started buying printing pres@@ ses in 14@@ 5@@ 5 -- to print out thousands , and then hundreds of thousands , and then ultimately millions of single , small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven .
how do we create ?
and we never think about the hidden connection .
when e@@ dis@@ on invented the light bul@@ b , pretty much looked like this .
you have to be kind of smart , and though i did not graduate from college doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today .
they have literally beat a path to our door .
when you listen to st@@ er@@ e@@ o on your home system , your both ears hear both speakers .
we &apos;ve got a problem with the an@@ ten@@ na r@@ ing@@ ing .
thank you once again .
so for this reason , i &apos;m particularly drawn to systems and patterns .
recently , i &apos;ve also made some rather hi@@ gh@@ bro@@ w b@@ ar@@ o@@ que borders out of lo@@ w@@ bro@@ w pa@@ st@@ a .
and i d@@ re@@ w each person their own unique val@@ ent@@ ine and put their name on it and nu@@ m@@ ber@@ ed it and signed it and sent it out .
i &apos;m certain i can see you bl@@ us@@ hing .
and i actually really feel that it &apos;s wor@@ th@@ while to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way .
in this mode , he &apos;s trying to maintain his position .
i thought i would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials .
also , when we think about future technologies , we start with the beginning of earth .
and you flip it over , and it &apos;s the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds with the ph at which they have different char@@ ges .
and through a process of selection evolution , you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you &apos;d like it to do , like grow a battery or grow a solar cell .
in this case , you &apos;re seeing oxygen bu@@ b@@ bles come out .
if you ask people the question : where do you really need to go when you need to get something done ?
i sat at my desk . i used my expensive computer .
and what ends up happening -- sometimes you might have days like this where you wake up at eight in the morning , or seven in the morning , or whenever you get up , and you &apos;re like , man , i didn &apos;t really sleep very well .
at the office , most of the inter@@ ru@@ p@@ tions and di@@ stra@@ ctions that really cause people not to get work done are in@@ v@@ ol@@ un@@ t@@ ary .
we all know this to be true , and you would never see a s@@ po@@ n@@ tan@@ e@@ ous meeting called by employees .
so meetings and man@@ a@@ gers are two major problems in businesses today , especially to o@@ ff@@ ic@@ es .
so maybe it &apos;s every other week , or every week , once a week , af@@ ter@@ no@@ ons no one can talk to each other .
and you know , to be honest , i &apos;ve been doing this for seven years , and i haven &apos;t got a c@@ lu@@ e what the future is going to be like .
but if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across con@@ te@@ x@@ ts -- most people will say ke@@ ys , money and , if they own one , a mobile phone .
but -- and it &apos;s a pretty big but -- we forget .
so , let me give you an example of d@@ el@@ e@@ g@@ ation in practice , right .
you take a 10 or 20 percent com@@ mission , and then you -- the ki@@ o@@ s@@ k op@@ er@@ ator takes 10 or 20 percent com@@ mission , and p@@ as@@ ses the rest over to you in cash .
it challenges the nor@@ ms .
and he , somehow , has the app@@ re@@ ci@@ ation of the values of li@@ ve@@ strong .
we &apos;re seeing , along with that pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of mobile devices , an ex@@ pe@@ c@@ tation of a@@ va@@ il@@ ability .
our reality right now is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
what were we just talking about ?
de@@ an or@@ n@@ is@@ h shares new research that shows how ad@@ op@@ ting healthy lifestyle h@@ ab@@ its can affect a person at a genetic level . for instance , he says , when you live he@@ al@@ th@@ i@@ er , eat better , exercise , and love more , your brain cells actually increase .
until i tell you who said it .
now within that framework , we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things .
when i went home that night after getting my t@@ at@@ too , i basically stayed up all night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s also a fifth one .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; re@@ p@@ ly all &quot; re@@ gre@@ ts can leave us in a fit of ex@@ c@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating ag@@ on@@ y for days .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;m a per@@ fe@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ist .
i thought in getting up to my ted wish i would try to begin by putting in perspective what i try to do and how it f@@ its with what they try to do .
none in india . there are now at least a half a million active .
and it occurred to me that in this whole non-@@ go@@ ver@@ n@@ mental world , somebody needs to be thinking about or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ zing public goods markets .
and so we have set about doing that .
listen to this : less than four-@@ ten@@ ths of one percent of those being treated stopped taking their medicine or otherwise de@@ f@@ au@@ l@@ ted on treatment .
it &apos;s worth a try and i believe it would succeed .
the des@@ ks are not square .
when the tur@@ b@@ ine dro@@ ps in , it will produce 8@@ ,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people are bringing their green in@@ du@@ stri@@ es , hopefully their green re@@ st@@ au@@ ran@@ ts , to the green school .
local bal@@ in@@ ese women cook the food on sa@@ w@@ dust bur@@ ners using se@@ cre@@ ts that only their grand@@ mothers know .
we need someone to come and study it .
green school is a model we built for the world .
my t@@ on@@ gue , l@@ ar@@ y@@ n@@ x and vo@@ cal cor@@ ds were still healthy and un@@ affected .
then apple released the al@@ e@@ x voice , which was the best i &apos;d heard .
there was a reason for that ; it was me .
the flow isn &apos;t natural .
but that &apos;s not the point .
for me , the internet began as a useful tool and now has become something i rely on for my actual daily existence .
it is human nature to look away from illness .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence -- the tur@@ ing test .
before , i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me once , &quot; what are you doing for a living ? &quot;
we treated two pages , both sp@@ re@@ ads , as a one page , because that &apos;s how re@@ a@@ ders per@@ c@@ ei@@ ve it .
so what is the lesson behind it ?
and my grandmother one time said , &quot; no , look , you &apos;re not going to run away .
it fo@@ am@@ ed , and horrible things were happening to me .
everybody lost faith in me being able to re@@ co@@ ver .
so they went to their st@@ or@@ age lo@@ ck@@ ers and all ga@@ ther@@ ed their extra furniture -- gave me po@@ ts and p@@ ans , b@@ lan@@ k@@ ets , everything .
you don &apos;t know how far that street is and you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going straight and you hear cars wh@@ i@@ z@@ zing back and forth , and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation .
i thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends .
for example , molecular structure .
and he took me up to the te@@ m@@ pl@@ es in ni@@ k@@ k@@ o .
can we say whether they discovered all of the sy@@ m@@ me@@ tries in the al@@ ham@@ br@@ a ?
i can &apos;t flip it because i &apos;ve put a little t@@ wi@@ st on it , haven &apos;t i ?
if i do one magic trick move followed by another , the combination is a third magic trick move .
now , g@@ al@@ o@@ is produced some laws for how these t@@ ab@@ les -- how sy@@ m@@ me@@ tries interact .
and it &apos;s a symmetry we call 6@@ -@@ 3@@ -@@ 2 .
rather than you all sh@@ ou@@ ting out , i want you to count how many di@@ g@@ its there are in that number . okay ?
i need your sur@@ name . sy@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ cal objects generally -- sp@@ el@@ l it for me .
first of all , worse nu@@ tri@@ tion , maybe sh@@ or@@ ter life sp@@ ans .
thomas e@@ dis@@ on would have been very , very comfortable in the atmosphere of a software fi@@ r@@ m today .
pen@@ ic@@ il@@ li@@ n was discovered in 19@@ 2@@ 8 , but even by 19@@ 40 , no com@@ mer@@ ci@@ ally and medi@@ cally useful qu@@ anti@@ ties of it were being produced .
it was the origin of the x@@ er@@ o@@ x c@@ op@@ i@@ er , which c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ated its 5@@ 0@@ th an@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ary last year .
the message , then , for me , about un@@ in@@ ten@@ ded consequences is chaos happens ; let &apos;s make better use of it .
it works on every computer , every web bro@@ w@@ s@@ er , or min@@ us , min@@ us , min@@ us to get smaller again .
also , don &apos;t d@@ el@@ e@@ te what you &apos;ve hi@@ gh@@ li@@ gh@@ ted .
and so one kind of information space that i take inspiration from is my real desk .
so one thing we have for that is like a grid al@@ ig@@ n , kind of -- so you get that more traditional des@@ k@@ top . things are kind of grid al@@ ig@@ ned .
now , i use my music to reach people &apos;s hearts and have found there are no boundaries .
but i think the point is that this is metaphor with teeth , and it &apos;s with those teeth that i want to pro@@ pos@@ e today that we re@@ think a little bit about the role of con@@ te@@ m@@ por@@ ary math -- not just financial math , but math in general .
and he said , &quot; well there &apos;s 2,000 ph@@ y@@ si@@ ci@@ sts on wall street now , and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find it here : this book about flies that you may have been looking at on amazon .
these aren &apos;t financial stat@@ s ; this is culture .
you can take it really , really far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s so interesting actually .
let &apos;s hear it . shake . l@@ ou@@ der .
let me tell you a secret .
so , un@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ alized inter@@ se@@ ctions , meaning stop signs , they save many lives , but there &apos;s an ex@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ve pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation of them .
the answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road sa@@ f@@ ely .
and war@@ r@@ en bu@@ ff@@ et had re@@ com@@ men@@ ded i do that -- being honest about what was going well , what wasn &apos;t , and making it kind of an an@@ nu@@ al thing .
in fact , if we look at the genetic code , it &apos;s the only disease we can see that people who lived in africa actually evolved several things to avoid mal@@ ari@@ al deaths .
it means that you can &apos;t get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .
but that alone doesn &apos;t give us the road map .
not only has that been we@@ a@@ k@@ . it &apos;s getting we@@ a@@ k@@ er .
a top qu@@ ar@@ ti@@ le teacher will increase the performance of their class -- based on test sc@@ or@@ es -- by over 10 percent in a single year .
but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .
what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and in fact , these free c@@ ou@@ r@@ ses could not only be available just on the internet , but you could make it so that d@@ v@@ ds were always available , and so anybody who has access to a d@@ v@@ d player can have the very best teachers .
everyday po@@ ts like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire .
the sc@@ ul@@ p@@ t@@ or richard ser@@ ra talks about how , as a young artist , he thought he was a pa@@ in@@ ter , and he lived in fl@@ or@@ ence after graduate school .
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that l@@ ing@@ ered on my clothes when i went home to my family at night .
and my mom and my dad were amazing . they were like , &apos; look , we know you &apos;re scared , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but it is so scary to think of ourselves as that powerful .
this is mass general in boston .
the pa@@ th@@ ologist takes that sample , fre@@ e@@ zes it , cu@@ ts it , looks in the microscope one by one and then calls back into the room .
so here in this situation , if you make a solution full of this three-@@ part molecule along with the dy@@ e , which is shown in green , and you in@@ je@@ ct it into the v@@ ei@@ n of someone who has cancer , normal tissue can &apos;t cut it .
but when s@@ ent@@ in@@ el l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ h no@@ de came into our treatment pro@@ to@@ co@@ l , the surgeon basically looks for the single no@@ de that is the first dra@@ in@@ ing l@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ h no@@ de of the cancer .
n@@ er@@ ves , if they are in@@ ju@@ red , can cause par@@ al@@ y@@ sis , can cause pain .
when we put these two pro@@ b@@ es together ...
we know that this can be done and we &apos;re committed to doing it .
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .
and it also will affect normal ci@@ r@@ cu@@ its as well as the ab@@ normal ones that you want to fix .
and early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004 , we gave it a try , and it worked on the first try .
now we &apos;ve shown that a brief ac@@ ti@@ v@@ ation of these is enough , indeed , to drive learning .
okay , there it goes . right now .
i wanted to close with one story , which we think could potentially be a clinical application .
and now you can see , the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again .
buildings are col@@ oni@@ zed by air@@ bor@@ ne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical v@@ en@@ ti@@ lation systems .
and when you &apos;re out@@ do@@ ors , that type of air has microbes that are com@@ mon@@ ly associated with plant leaves and with di@@ r@@ t .
and obviously i &apos;m physically a very strong person , as you can tell -- -- so i wasn &apos;t worried about carrying this thing 20 blocks .
same thing to the question of , who was keeping the streets alive post-@@ 9 / 11 in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
and one of the things that i ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent@@ ed with is this thing called google share which is basically , you take an abstract term , and you search google for that term , and then you search the results that you get back for somebody &apos;s name .
that &apos;s bri@@ t@@ ne@@ y spe@@ ars . i mean , you know , ok , interesting .
if you &apos;re the second site there , most people link to you .
what was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now r@@ ari@@ fied .
made in 19@@ 3@@ 9 , the film is older than most of our members &apos; grand@@ parents .
was the t@@ al@@ e told well ?
we honor reading , why not honor watching with the same passion ?
it comes in california with a war@@ ning -- &quot; this product contains chemicals known by the state of california to cause cancer and birth de@@ fe@@ cts or other re@@ productive harm . &quot;
so perhaps we could develop a strategy of change , which requires hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ty . and in my business as an architect , it &apos;s un@@ fortunate the word &quot; hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ty &quot; and the word &quot; architect &quot; have not appeared in the same par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph since &quot; the fo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ head . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone age didn &apos;t end because we ran out of stones . &quot;
and this might have worked in ber@@ li@@ n , but we built it in h@@ ou@@ st@@ on , and the windows are all closed . and with most products ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing not to have been designed for in@@ door use , this is actually a vertical gas ch@@ am@@ ber .
now if we look at the word &quot; competition , &quot; i &apos;m sure most of you &apos;ve used it .
we have since d@@ at@@ ab@@ as@@ ed the 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 most com@@ mon@@ ly used chemicals in human manufacturing , and we &apos;re r@@ el@@ e@@ as@@ ing this d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase into the public in six weeks .
and we now have 3@@ 5@@ 0@@ -@@ po@@ un@@ d au@@ to workers learning bird songs on the internet .
we start to in@@ te@@ gra@@ te commercial and mixed use so the people all have centers and places to be .
and this here is the in@@ famous n@@ s@@ a data center in u@@ ta@@ h .
and that &apos;s not true . don &apos;t let anybody tell you that we knew this already , because we did not know this already .
so for example , they name the collection from microsoft started on september 11 , 2007 , for y@@ a@@ ho@@ o on the march 12 , 2008 , and then others : google , facebook , sk@@ y@@ p@@ e , apple and so on .
i &apos;m speaking of sweden because sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the united states .
and wh@@ o@@ ever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn &apos;t thought about this long enough .
her email was read , and she spoke at the united nations head@@ quar@@ ters , and she said , &quot; if there is no right to pri@@ v@@ ac@@ y , there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion , and therefore , there can be no effective democracy . &quot;
most people , when they first look at a fresh human brain , they say , &quot; it doesn &apos;t look what you &apos;re typically looking at when someone shows you a brain . &quot;
and all of these b@@ lan@@ k areas are the areas in which the wi@@ r@@ es are running through .
and the nature of a given cell driving its under@@ lying bio@@ chemistry is di@@ ct@@ ated by which of these 2@@ 5,000 genes are turned on and at what level they &apos;re turned on .
so this is where experts come in and they make basic an@@ at@@ om@@ ic as@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ments .
we take that ta@@ g@@ ged material and we put it on to something called a micro@@ ar@@ ray .
so what can scientists learn about this data ?
they look at their entire gen@@ om@@ es , and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked c@@ au@@ s@@ ally to genes .
whether or not that &apos;s due to an individual &apos;s genetic background or their experiences , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how to er@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ate poverty , we just need to do more ?
so here are some other questions .
how do you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , be@@ fore@@ hand , everything is the same .
and many experiments have been run , and they all have the same results , so i &apos;m just going to talk to you about one .
so what &apos;s the best ?
we need that kind of information , we need more of it , and then we need to guide policy .
and maybe we can get started small with things that we know are effective .
al@@ le@@ vi@@ ating poverty is more gu@@ es@@ s@@ work than science , and lack of data on aid &apos;s impact ra@@ is@@ es questions about how to provide it . but c@@ l@@ ar@@ k me@@ d@@ al-@@ w@@ inner es@@ ther du@@ fl@@ o says it &apos;s possible to know which development efforts help and which hurt -- by testing solutions with r@@ and@@ om@@ ized trials .
so let &apos;s get going because africa , to some degree , is on a tur@@ n@@ around .
and le@@ gen@@ d has it that al@@ ex@@ an@@ der tre@@ k@@ ked through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa in over 1,000 languages , and it wouldn &apos;t make a difference . &quot;
so let &apos;s start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data .
i want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets .
in tan@@ z@@ ani@@ a last week , we had the launch of the east african organic produce standard .
if i had to ask you , &quot; in 2005 what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world ? &quot; would egypt come to mind ?
because there are amazing opportunities available .
god is that personal journey we all want to be on , to be inspired , to feel like we &apos;re connected to a universe that c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ates life .
you flip a switch and there is electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought they did .
so i &apos;m going to just let it run , so you kind of ab@@ sor@@ b this sort of thing , and i &apos;ll describe my sort of re@@ actions when i was looking at it for the very first time .
precisely .
ok , s@@ wa@@ p them around , put your right hand up .
k@@ t : yes .
k@@ t : no , no , i &apos;m just still looking at the road .
i couldn &apos;t see through the b@@ lin@@ d@@ fold .
they &apos;ve already gone .
kb : how many times did you feel it ?
allow your eyes to close , on five , four , three , two , one .
only when you want the pressure to be released , make an up@@ ward ge@@ st@@ ure , like this , but only when you want the pressure to be released .
do you want to try it ?
in a moment , you &apos;ll feel a certain sen@@ sa@@ tion , ok , and when you feel that sen@@ sa@@ tion , i want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle .
i &apos;ve got one more thing to share with you right now .
you done ?
my hand is at life , here , so -- at risk .
kb : ok . do you think it &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first , k@@ ei@@ th bar@@ ry shows us how our brains can fo@@ ol our bodies -- in a trick that works via po@@ d@@ cast too . then he involves the audience in some ja@@ w@@ -@@ dro@@ pping fe@@ ats of brain magic .
per@@ k up .
this isn &apos;t for the one in four . this is for the four in four .
i saw that people who were religious and non-@@ religious were equally obsessed with morality .
bas@@ el@@ ine levels are near zero , without some st@@ im@@ ul@@ us to cause its release .
and they get a message by computer saying person one sent you this amount of money .
we showed that o@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in in@@ fu@@ sion increases gener@@ o@@ si@@ ty in un@@ il@@ at@@ er@@ al mon@@ et@@ ary trans@@ f@@ ers by 80 percent .
i just found the molecule behind it .
again he asked me , &quot; what do you think we should do ? &quot;
so we , in experiments , have ad@@ min@@ i@@ st@@ er@@ ed te@@ sto@@ st@@ er@@ one to men .
so i think it tells us that we &apos;ve designed this ri@@ tu@@ al to connect us to this new couple , connect us e@@ mo@@ ti@@ on@@ ally .
and it &apos;s so easy to cause people &apos;s brains to release o@@ x@@ y@@ to@@ c@@ in .
in order to have that machine running , you need lots and lots of people .
or should they not ?
in an ir@@ ri@@ t@@ ated voice , they said , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a machine that works only in english , so we had to teach ourselves english in order to use it . &quot;
i decided i would destroy my own argument by creating an ab@@ sur@@ d pro@@ position .
ab@@ sur@@ d . but i had to follow the vi@@ ct@@ ori@@ an nor@@ m .
what will it be tomorrow ?
we need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure .
i think that &apos;s what all this is pointing at .
i &apos;ve tried incredible , incredible questions -- &quot; when did the world begin ? how will it end ? &quot; — to n@@ in@@ e-@@ year-olds .
and just one last thing .
maybe we &apos;ll go into the next t@@ un@@ e , because i totally lost where this is going .
now shi@@ v@@ du@@ t@@ t was vis@@ it@@ ing the local land re@@ gi@@ st@@ r@@ y office in u@@ tt@@ ar pra@@ des@@ h , and he discovered that official records were li@@ sting him as dead .
so it &apos;s more dis@@ or@@ der@@ ed .
it &apos;s common among a pri@@ vi@@ le@@ ged class capable of paying nu@@ mer@@ ous do@@ w@@ ri@@ es and keeping multiple homes .
following those four children is z@@ u@@ m@@ r@@ a &apos;s younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well .
and finally , another individual sat for me from behind and later res@@ c@@ in@@ ded his par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion , so i had to pi@@ x@@ el@@ ate him out so he &apos;s un@@ re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ able .
children have to leave the or@@ ph@@ an@@ age at age 16 , despite the fact that there &apos;s often nowhere for them to go .
one of the interesting things , of course , is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology , and of course what he said about listening to our young people .
now my career may last a little longer !
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
he would have the sound coming through the res@@ on@@ ators .
or we go like that , and we imagine that &apos;s what b@@ lin@@ dness is about .
rain . not bad . not bad .
single st@@ ro@@ ke ro@@ l@@ l@@ s . so why can &apos;t i then do that wh@@ il@@ st learning a piece of music ?
in this so@@ ar@@ ing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion , de@@ a@@ f per@@ c@@ us@@ si@@ on@@ ist e@@ v@@ el@@ y@@ n gl@@ en@@ n@@ ie il@@ lu@@ st@@ r@@ ates how listening to music involves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your ear@@ d@@ ru@@ ms .
and it got big enough to the point where there was a flo@@ at last year at the ma@@ cy &apos;s th@@ an@@ k@@ s@@ giving day par@@ a@@ de , and ri@@ ck a@@ st@@ ley po@@ ps out , and ri@@ ck@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ s millions of people on television .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
c@@ p : you &apos;re lucky that this is not being st@@ re@@ am@@ ed to them live right now .
love and peace were mentioned .
c@@ p : yeah . they still didn &apos;t know what to think of that though .
and that is 10 times longer than it took the mammals to achieve ma@@ x@@ im@@ um body size and inv@@ a@@ de all those h@@ ab@@ it@@ ats .
we are extremely din@@ o@@ s@@ au@@ r@@ -like , and unusual in our two-@@ le@@ g@@ ged approach to life .
basically you &apos;re talking about a country that , when we started working there , did not have con@@ ta@@ in@@ er traffic .
that &apos;s an adult or@@ in@@ oc@@ o cro@@ co@@ di@@ le in its ja@@ ws .
paul has never seen a fossil do that .
these are all land@@ lu@@ b@@ bing animals . there &apos;s a couple of choices .
i became an artist . o@@ .@@ k@@ . , and started drawing .
and the question is -- and we started to address this question for centuries -- as to how we get these kids involved in science .
except -- bad news for der@@ ar@@ t@@ u tu@@ l@@ u -- some other people had the same idea , including the ol@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ic gold me@@ d@@ al@@ ist and p@@ au@@ la ra@@ d@@ cli@@ ff@@ e , who is a mon@@ ster , the fa@@ st@@ est woman mar@@ a@@ th@@ on@@ er in history by far .
you show me a creature with we@@ b@@ bed feet and g@@ il@@ l@@ s ; somehow water &apos;s involved .
now we &apos;re not using our strength because we are the biggest s@@ is@@ si@@ es in the j@@ un@@ g@@ le .
well e@@ mi@@ ly ba@@ er -- 500 r@@ un@@ ners -- she fin@@ is@@ h@@ es in ei@@ gh@@ th place , in the top 10 , even though she stopped at all the aid stations to bre@@ a@@ st@@ feed her baby during the race -- and yet , beat 4@@ 9@@ 2 other people .
that &apos;s all we could do .
but maybe it &apos;s something different .
stop focusing on urban mar@@ a@@ th@@ ons , which , if you do four hours , you su@@ ck .
ro@@ bo@@ tics had really been about interacting with things , not with people -- certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives .
co@@ o@@ k@@ ie mon@@ ster is very , very bad .
the remote c@@ ol@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ ator was an ex@@ per@@ im@@ enter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts .
and through this technology , being able to be an active par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ant in their grand@@ children &apos;s lives in a way that &apos;s not possible today .
and the third was just a pen and paper lo@@ g , because that &apos;s the standard inter@@ ven@@ tion you typically get when you start a di@@ et@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ exercise program .
another important idea is this notion of per@@ si@@ st@@ ence of character across re@@ ali@@ ties .
i &apos;m st@@ y@@ li@@ n &apos; , s@@ mi@@ li@@ n &apos; , lo@@ o@@ k@@ in &apos; real mean , because it ain &apos;t about being heard , just being seen .
took off fast , didn &apos;t get far . i fi@@ red , &apos; po@@ w ! &apos; fo@@ ol fell between two par@@ ked cars .
when he was writing a bro@@ ad@@ way show , i would be outside of the door .
i show a number of photographs and films , but i also make television programs , books and some advertising , all with the same concept .
so , the photograph becomes this te@@ as@@ er and in@@ c@@ ites desire and vo@@ ye@@ ur@@ ism ; what you can &apos;t have , you want more .
how they wh@@ e@@ ed@@ le their way into the collective p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e without us even knowing , and how that should happen .
it &apos;s highly commercial .
and then you change the photograph he &apos;s shooting at , and it suddenly becomes rather gri@@ m and maybe less accessible . .
8@@ 5 percent of global disease bur@@ den for car@@ di@@ o@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar disease is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the west .
easy to treat . look at the situation in m@@ au@@ ri@@ ti@@ us .
but start telling them , you know , we &apos;re going to try to do it in nigeria -- everyone runs away .
it ex@@ ten@@ ds opportunity to the rural centers , and we can use ex@@ per@@ ti@@ se in a very smart way .
pre@@ ven@@ tion must be part of the solution -- we em@@ ph@@ as@@ i@@ ze that .
and we are starting a bi@@ om@@ e@@ di@@ cal engineering program , so that we will train people lo@@ cally , who can repair that equipment .
autism is a very big con@@ tin@@ u@@ um that goes from very severe -- the child remains non-@@ ver@@ b@@ al -- all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers .
in fact , i loved the movie , how they du@@ p@@ li@@ cated all my projects . that &apos;s the ge@@ e@@ k side .
now , one of the things i learned very early on because i wasn &apos;t that social , is i had to sell my work , and not myself .
now , another thing is the sensory issues .
in other words , cat@@ e@@ g@@ ori@@ ze equipment problem from a people problem .
he was now dr. car@@ lo@@ ck in the movie .
i did inter@@ n@@ ships in college , i was building things , and i also had to learn how to do as@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ments .
another thing that can be very , very , very successful is there is a lot of people that may have re@@ ti@@ red from working in the software industry , and they can teach your kid .
t@@ g : i &apos;m passionate about that the things i do are going to make the world a better place .
it &apos;s an au@@ g@@ m@@ ent@@ ed reality pro@@ je@@ ction tracking and ma@@ pping system , or a digital st@@ or@@ y@@ telling tool .
it &apos;s the fifth time i stand on this sh@@ ore , the cu@@ b@@ an sh@@ ore , looking out at that distant h@@ ori@@ z@@ on , be@@ li@@ e@@ ving , again , that i &apos;m going to make it all the way across that vast , dangerous wil@@ der@@ ness of an ocean .
but it was deeper . it was , how much life is there left ?
and then we kind of have a car@@ din@@ al rule that i &apos;m never told , really , how far it is , because we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but the truth is , all those or@@ ations that i had pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ed just to get myself through some training s@@ wi@@ ms as motivation , it wasn &apos;t like that .
thank you very much and enjoy the conference .
and perhaps most tra@@ gi@@ cally , he lost his self-@@ worth .
he jo@@ ins the army . the army gives him a ri@@ f@@ le .
so , what happens when a medium suddenly puts a lot of new ideas into ci@@ r@@ cu@@ lation ?
they had to quickly sy@@ n@@ ch@@ r@@ oni@@ ze what other natural p@@ hi@@ lo@@ s@@ op@@ her@@ s knew . otherwise , you couldn &apos;t get the right kind of argument going .
but there was one pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ er who decided that this wasn &apos;t the way to work .
each of them can make changes and they can mer@@ ge them after the fact even if they didn &apos;t know of each other &apos;s existence be@@ fore@@ hand .
this is a called a &quot; di@@ ff , &quot; this thing on the right here .
a m@@ om@@ ent@@ ous thing that can happen to a culture is they can ac@@ qui@@ re a new style of ar@@ gu@@ ing : trial by j@@ ur@@ y , v@@ ot@@ ing , pe@@ er review , now this . right ?
don &apos;t try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing , because that doesn &apos;t get you very far .
and anyone who tells you you can &apos;t , you don &apos;t listen to them .
six to nine months at the right time of the year .
but we really made sure we tested those ro@@ vers before we got them down -- or that ro@@ ver -- and made sure that it &apos;s all working well .
so we have a sp@@ ac@@ e@@ cra@@ ft which is head@@ ing towards mars , called p@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x , and that sp@@ ac@@ e@@ cra@@ ft will land 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds from now , so you can ad@@ just your watch .
and that would be bad .
so we are in the process , as we speak , of actually designing the next ro@@ ver that we are going to be sending to mars .
and i know many of you , kind of , last time afterwards said well , that was a cool thing to have -- those air@@ b@@ ag@@ s .
well , there were two s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ tes which were particularly interesting .
so it &apos;s very much like the cycle on earth except because it &apos;s so cold , it could not be water , you know , because water would have frozen .
what i &apos;d like to talk about today is understanding these ex@@ po@@ n@@ en@@ ti@@ al technologies .
so let &apos;s see now how ex@@ po@@ n@@ en@@ ti@@ al technologies are taking health care .
and this is an example of this paradigm shift .
so imagine we already have wireless scales .
and i think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients , and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine , as au@@ g@@ m@@ ent@@ ed by these sorts of technologies .
but the trend in medicine actually is to get ex@@ po@@ n@@ en@@ ti@@ ally smaller .
in gen@@ om@@ ics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
through we@@ b@@ sites like patients like me or man@@ aging your data on microsoft he@@ al@@ th@@ v@@ au@@ lt or google health , le@@ ver@@ aging this together in par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pat@@ ory ways is going to become increasingly important .
we take our own bone mar@@ row cells and treat a patient with a heart attack , we can see much im@@ pro@@ ved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone mar@@ row drive cells after a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; di@@ r@@ t . &quot;
her cats , god knows how many , who must p@@ is@@ s on her ru@@ gs -- her land@@ ing &apos;s a si@@ ck@@ en@@ ing re@@ e@@ k .
her crossing the fra@@ g@@ m@@ ent@@ ed ti@@ les , f@@ al@@ ter@@ ing at the step to the street , dr@@ on@@ ing , not looking at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was afraid some re@@ pres@@ sed part of myself would go out of control , and i &apos;d be forever ent@@ ra@@ pped in the sho@@ cking se@@ e@@ the of her st@@ en@@ ch .
but i &apos;m afraid that ri@@ ck@@ y will come out here and shake his f@@ ist at me .
when we make love , her holding me everywhere all around me , i &apos;m there and not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that sh@@ ine an un@@ com@@ pro@@ mis@@ ing light on cru@@ ci@@ al issues , images that tr@@ an@@ sc@@ end borders , that tr@@ an@@ sc@@ end religions , images that pro@@ vo@@ ke us to step up and do something -- in other words , to act .
in the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , the st@@ ig@@ ma@@ ti@@ zation of people with the disease was an enormous bar@@ ri@@ er to even dis@@ c@@ us@@ sing or ad@@ d@@ res@@ sing it .
j@@ on@@ a@@ than k@@ l@@ ei@@ n : photos that changed the world
i &apos;d read lots of books . i studied maps and char@@ ts .
i could see myself sti@@ cking the fla@@ g in a pole , you know -- ah , gl@@ ori@@ ous moment -- the music kind of reaching a c@@ res@@ c@@ en@@ do .
finally , morning of day 11 , we got the all-@@ clear , lo@@ ad@@ ed up the he@@ li@@ c@@ op@@ ters -- two he@@ li@@ c@@ op@@ ters flying in tan@@ de@@ m -- dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice .
i knew there was more open water . and i had a secret weapon up my sle@@ e@@ ve .
i knew this , but i was ex@@ pe@@ cting something .
this was the view outside my t@@ ent when i had this f@@ at@@ e@@ ful phone call .
and only from the air did i see the big picture .
and they turned around , headed back to the coast , and all five of them died on the return journey .
this is coming from a jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot .
but a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; what would have happened if this dr@@ un@@ ken guy was not in that condition ?
one day in 18@@ 19 , 3,000 miles off the coast of chi@@ le , in one of the most remote regions of the pacific ocean , 20 american sa@@ il@@ ors watched their ship flo@@ o@@ d with se@@ a@@ water .
but at a certain point , most of us learn to leave these kinds of v@@ is@@ i@@ ons behind and grow up .
they have the same architecture .
now , some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others .
read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday c@@ la@@ ir@@ vo@@ y@@ ance , a way of g@@ li@@ m@@ p@@ sing what might be the future when there &apos;s still time to influence how that future will play out .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we put it in every sitting room in the arab world -- and inter@@ na@@ ti@@ on@@ ally , globally , through our english channel .
they have been de@@ ta@@ ched from their people , from the mas@@ ses , and now we are seeing them col@@ la@@ p@@ sing one after the other .
i thank you very much .
because we discovered that people care , and people would like to know -- they are re@@ c@@ ei@@ ving the stream through our internet .
and f@@ r@@ an@@ k@@ ie says , &quot; i &apos;m number 22 in line , and i can see the ne@@ e@@ d@@ le coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
you don &apos;t want to share a ne@@ e@@ d@@ le anymore than you want to share a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ us@@ h even with someone you &apos;re sleeping with .
so , these are re@@ vi@@ e@@ ws of hundreds of studies by all the big mu@@ ck@@ et@@ y-@@ mu@@ cks of the scientific pan@@ the@@ on in the united states , and these are the studies that show ne@@ e@@ d@@ le programs are effective -- quite a lot of them .
you can see these h@@ or@@ ri@@ fying figures from africa .
now , am i saying , &quot; oh , well , great pre@@ ven@@ tion strategy .
ines is a a trans@@ gender ho@@ o@@ ker on the streets of ja@@ kar@@ ta ; she &apos;s a ch@@ ic@@ k with a di@@ ck .
she was 10@@ 5 years old when i took this picture .
hey , hey bl@@ ac@@ k@@ -@@ e@@ yed su@@ s@@ ie , hey .
and play a little ban@@ j@@ o . let &apos;s do a little me@@ d@@ ley .
we were driving in the car outside of g@@ at@@ es@@ vi@@ l@@ le , texas , where i grew up in the early part of my life .
and mom was just sitting by the car like this .
try this old song with me . i sing : well , there &apos;s a long white ro@@ be in heaven , i know .
it was originally made by the d@@ op@@ y@@ era brothers , who later on made the do@@ br@@ o , which is a wo@@ o@@ d-@@ bo@@ died instrument with a metal c@@ one for -- where the sound comes from .
oh yeah , that &apos;s easier said than done .
we weren &apos;t stupid : we put up a sheet of pl@@ y@@ wood about five feet in front of it .
when dr@@ um machines were new , i got to thinking , why couldn &apos;t you take the oldest form of music , the ham@@ bone r@@ hy@@ th@@ ms , and combine it with the ne@@ west technology ?
well , my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bo@@ un@@ d together by an e@@ th@@ ics .
it &apos;s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space , because that &apos;s defined , not with respect to say , where other things are , but with respect to this absolute notion of space , which for new@@ ton was god .
and in a rel@@ a@@ tional universe the only possible explanation was , somehow it made itself .
and you understand some things better than other things , and because of that there &apos;s a con@@ tin@@ u@@ al jo@@ st@@ ling and give and take , which is politics .
there is a fellow te@@ d@@ ster who spoke two years ago , j@@ on@@ a@@ than ha@@ i@@ d@@ t , who defined his work into three different levels .
and then just leave it all to them .
he clo@@ ses it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff .
was not very successful . and so on and so forth .
or p@@ hi@@ li@@ p glass or lo@@ u re@@ ed or the chemical brothers , who all per@@ formed there , get their own cas@@ a da mu@@ si@@ ca lo@@ go .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
just a bit too or@@ n@@ am@@ ent@@ al .
and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s just as much about the identity of the living as it is about re@@ me@@ m@@ br@@ ance of the dead .
but the s@@ ac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce of bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o and the ri@@ tu@@ al display of wealth also ex@@ hi@@ bits the status of the de@@ ce@@ as@@ ed , and , by ex@@ ten@@ sion , the de@@ ce@@ as@@ ed &apos;s family .
if we could expand our definition of death to en@@ comp@@ as@@ s life , we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear .
i was planning on fin@@ is@@ h@@ ing on a dance ...
her talk about the a@@ qu@@ a@@ tic ap@@ e , and the link , of course , the link between dar@@ win@@ ism and the fact that we are all naked ben@@ e@@ at@@ h this -- we &apos;re not hi@@ r@@ su@@ te and we can swim rather well .
al@@ right g@@ or@@ don , come on , e@@ h .
&quot; and now it &apos;s got a han@@ go@@ ver . &quot;
that &apos;s eight years of american history , eight minutes of my act , just gone like that .
and jack ni@@ ch@@ ol@@ son just says , &quot; you make me want to be a better man . &quot;
&quot; make this world a better place , if you can .
so i &apos;ll just give you my message up front : try not to go extinct .
where are all the little ones ? &quot;
so this is where people went a@@ stra@@ y again .
now as you can imagine , cutting open a leg bone is one thing , but when you go to a museum and say , &quot; you don &apos;t mind if i cut open your dinosaur &apos;s skull do you ? &quot;
and one would think , that should give me a c@@ lu@@ e .
so we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones .
so now we know that tor@@ o@@ s@@ au@@ ru@@ s is actually a gro@@ w@@ nu@@ p tri@@ c@@ er@@ at@@ op@@ s .
it looks like it could still get bigger .
we wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere .
so , all the w@@ at@@ ers of the world are served there , so we thought that , you know , after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water , you could also drink this building .
so , the drill was mo@@ un@@ ted on this robotic arm .
then you come up in this glass el@@ e@@ v@@ ator right near the cur@@ ta@@ in wall .
before and after shot .
and this is a guy from s@@ al@@ t lake city , this is what they look like out there .
&quot; drawn into this , &quot; like they were se@@ du@@ ced into com@@ mit@@ ting an act of violence .
she &apos;s not sure that would have happened if the edi@@ t@@ or had not been a female .
by the way , apparently wired took all this to heart .
an@@ al@@ y@@ ze your news , and speak up when there are g@@ ap@@ s missing in co@@ ver@@ age like people at the new york times did .
and this particular plant re@@ moves for@@ mal@@ de@@ hy@@ des and other v@@ ol@@ a@@ ti@@ le chemicals .
m most of the time i spend when i get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen .
and one of the things -- if you remember con@@ do@@ le@@ e@@ zz@@ a rice was at some event and she wor@@ e bo@@ ots , and she got cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed over that .
p@@ m : and did you get p@@ us@@ h@@ back from making that a central ten@@ ant of foreign policy ?
when i was se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary of state , there were only 13 other women foreign min@@ i@@ sters .
thank you for jo@@ in@@ ing us today .
malaria : there are eight countries in sub-@@ sa@@ har@@ an africa that have their death rates cut by 75 percent .
for nu@@ m@@ ber@@ -@@ cr@@ un@@ ch@@ ers like us , that is the er@@ o@@ gen@@ ous zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that i am , by now , se@@ x@@ u@@ ally ar@@ ou@@ s@@ ed by the c@@ ol@@ l@@ ating of data .
in fact , today in your capital , in difficult times , some who mind the nation &apos;s pur@@ se want to cut li@@ fe@@ -@@ saving programs like the global fund .
in fact , it could save co@@ un@@ t@@ less lives .
so now , if you take this metaphor &#91; of &#93; genome as program seriously , you have to consider that chris an@@ der@@ son is a com@@ pu@@ ter@@ -@@ f@@ ab@@ ri@@ cated ar@@ ti@@ fact , as is j@@ im w@@ at@@ son , cra@@ i@@ g v@@ ent@@ er , as are all of us .
you &apos;re going to design something like a cell phone , and in a high-@@ level language , you &apos;ll describe that cell phone .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna .
we heat them up , we add a little bit of s@@ al@@ t , we heat them up to almost bo@@ il@@ ing and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short st@@ r@@ and@@ s b@@ in@@ d the long st@@ r@@ and@@ s and start to form structure .
so , this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes , ok ?
you zoom in , there are just four dna st@@ r@@ and@@ s and they have little s@@ ing@@ le-@@ st@@ r@@ and@@ ed bits on them that can b@@ in@@ d to other ti@@ les , if they match .
you have a very sensitive computer program where small changes -- single , tiny , little mu@@ tations -- can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger .
and the com@@ pu@@ tations that it uses , they &apos;re molecular com@@ pu@@ tations , and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it , as fe@@ y@@ n@@ man said , you know , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we en@@ v@@ is@@ i@@ on@@ ed it , we had three key goals : providing wor@@ l@@ d-@@ class life support am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce service which is fully self-@@ sustainable from its own revenue st@@ re@@ am@@ s , and uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency , ir@@ res@@ pe@@ ctive of the cap@@ ability to pay .
in the modern day world , where time is pre@@ mi@@ um and battle for sub@@ si@@ st@@ ence is uni@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ ably tough , the ha@@ pl@@ ess common man simply gives in and pa@@ ys the bri@@ be just to get on with life .
in my last 18 months as a la@@ w@@ yer , bat@@ t@@ ling s@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ - and l@@ ar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale corruption , including the one per@@ pet@@ r@@ ated by india &apos;s biggest corporate sc@@ am@@ ster .
s@@ m : well , actually the cost that we in@@ cur@@ red was less than 200 ru@@ pe@@ es .
so what we &apos;ve got here now is the global footprint of all the te@@ d@@ x talks over the last four years explo@@ ding out around the world from new york all the way down to little old new z@@ e@@ al@@ and in the corner .
now often , when we &apos;re faced with this amount of content , we do a couple of things to si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ fy it .
so we &apos;re using these network mo@@ ti@@ f@@ s to find talks that are unique , ones that are cre@@ a@@ tively sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ zing a lot of different fields , ones that are central to their topic , and ones that are really cre@@ a@@ tively bri@@ d@@ ging dis@@ par@@ ate fields .
no wonder so many of my people sp@@ it bars , because the truth is hard to s@@ wal@@ low .
the j@@ an@@ it@@ or &apos;s job could just as well be done in a mor@@ tu@@ ary as in a hospital .
at ted , bri@@ l@@ li@@ ance is ra@@ m@@ p@@ ant .
how do things like this happen ?
second , no doubt more familiar to you , is the nature of modern american education : sc@@ ri@@ p@@ ted , lo@@ ck@@ -@@ step cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ a .
and they said , &quot; would you be willing to have a nuclear waste du@@ m@@ p in your community ? &quot;
one way not to do it : teach more e@@ th@@ ics c@@ ou@@ r@@ ses .
why ? because there happy to be doing something that &apos;s the right thing to do .
bill gates talked about the importance of education and , in particular , the model that ki@@ p@@ p was providing : &quot; knowledge is power . &quot;
bar@@ ry s@@ ch@@ war@@ t@@ z makes a passionate call for &quot; practical wisdom &quot; as an anti@@ do@@ te to a society gone mad with bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy . he ar@@ gu@@ es po@@ w@@ er@@ fully that rules often fail us , incentives often back@@ fire , and practical , everyday wisdom will help rebuild our world .
&quot; oh , by the way de@@ an . it &apos;s going to fit on a 5@@ 0@@ th per@@ c@@ en@@ ti@@ le female frame -- n@@ am@@ ely 32 inches from the long finger -- and w@@ ei@@ g@@ h less than nine pounds . &quot;
it will take the other nine to make it functional and useful . &quot;
and now he &apos;s going to do what dar@@ p@@ a asked me for .
&quot; guys , and woman , you &apos;ve given enough .
and it was a@@ sto@@ und@@ ing how positive they are .
he wants to help . he told me that he wanted to go back to help his bu@@ d@@ dies .
how do we get out ?
it can make war seem like tragedy or far@@ ce .
ford und@@ res@@ sed . she spread one leg , and then the other .
in london i lived in a glass box for 4@@ 4 days with nothing but water .
and i was shi@@ ver@@ ing . in my first attempt to hold my breath i couldn &apos;t even last a minute .
there is de@@ p@@ th records , where people go as deep as they can .
he &apos;s six foot four . he &apos;s 1@@ 60 pounds .
because of the movement i was wa@@ sting oxygen .
then his main com@@ pe@@ ti@@ t@@ or went out and broke his record .
and there is no way to slow my heart rate down .
at 14 minutes , i had these awful contra@@ ctions , like this ur@@ ge to breathe .
as a ma@@ gi@@ ci@@ an i try to show things to people that seem impossible .
con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ la@@ tions . you have now comp@@ le@@ ted se@@ tu@@ p .
t@@ am@@ ar@@ a , are you recording ?
even now , man may be un@@ wi@@ tt@@ ingly changing the world &apos;s climate through the waste products of his civilization .
in africa last year , africans ate 600 million wild animals , and con@@ su@@ m@@ ed two billion ki@@ lo@@ gra@@ ms of bush meat .
first , even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today , global warming would continue .
and then we watched , as one case arrived on the east coast of the united states and it mar@@ ched every year , we@@ st@@ war@@ dly .
today , there &apos;s another kind of movement . it &apos;s a movement to save the earth .
ph@@ ar@@ a@@ oh ra@@ m@@ ses the fifth , whose picture is here , died of smallpox .
so i want to take you through a kind of wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species , as well as our cultures , because of this change .
and if that were all this was about , then it would be an interesting thing .
the sal@@ m@@ on on top is a gen@@ e@@ tically en@@ g@@ ine@@ ered ch@@ in@@ o@@ ok sal@@ m@@ on , using a gene from these sal@@ m@@ on and from one other fish that we eat , to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed .
these are really hy@@ bri@@ ds , not pure animals .
we &apos;ve taken away the au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ y of this animal . &quot;
in other words , that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent -- it did not have an organic parent .
paul root w@@ ol@@ pe : it &apos;s time to question bio@@ -@@ engineering
if only darwin had nasa .
m@@ el@@ an@@ in , in various forms , has probably been on the earth a billion years , and has been re@@ cru@@ ited over and over again by evolution , as often happens .
and just in the last 5,000 years , in increasing rates , over increasing di@@ st@@ an@@ ces .
evolution helps us .
spread the word .
because old and ancient as it may be , it &apos;s very complicated and it &apos;s very simple , both at the same time .
well , you measure and measure and measure .
so i found myself , in other words , con@@ st@@ ru@@ c@@ ting a ge@@ om@@ et@@ ry , a ge@@ om@@ et@@ ry of things which had no ge@@ om@@ et@@ ry .
so it was in 18@@ 75 to 19@@ 25 , an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world .
long me@@ as@@ u@@ re@@ ments , big bro@@ w@@ ni@@ an mo@@ tions , 1.@@ 3@@ 3 .
and you have the little non@@ sense which is left .
and that was one of my major discoveries , to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing , more or less .
should it be a ma@@ ste@@ ct@@ om@@ y ? should it be a l@@ um@@ pe@@ ct@@ om@@ y ?
right ? it needs to be al@@ er@@ t , for which ca@@ ff@@ e@@ in@@ e is very good .
anyone ? it &apos;s much more difficult .
and this can happen in the medical do@@ main .
and why not ?
she comes back to the market some months later , when prices are highest , in what we call the le@@ an season -- when food is sc@@ ar@@ ce -- because she has to feed her family and has no choice .
and this leads to very high hand@@ ling costs .
nearly three years ago , i decided to leave my comfortable job as a world bank sen@@ i@@ or economist in washington and come back to my country of birth , ethiopia , after nearly 30 years ab@@ road .
we &apos;re creating a system that ser@@ ves all market ac@@ t@@ ors , that creates in@@ te@@ gri@@ ty , trust , efficiency , transparency and en@@ ab@@ les small farmers to manage the risks that i have described .
we believe that this in@@ i@@ ti@@ ative requires great political will , and we &apos;ll have to al@@ ig@@ n the financial sector , as well as the ic@@ t sector , and really even the under@@ lying legal framework .
my response is a s@@ and@@ stone wall made from bacteria and so@@ li@@ di@@ fied sand , st@@ re@@ t@@ ching across the desert .
it seriously th@@ re@@ at@@ ens the li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ o@@ ds of millions of people , and especially in africa and china .
but , one of the problems with pl@@ an@@ ting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they ch@@ o@@ p them down for fire@@ wood .
and , after an initial cost of 60 bu@@ cks to buy the bacteria , which you &apos;ll never have to pay again , one cu@@ bi@@ c meter of bac@@ ter@@ i@@ al sand would be about 11 dollars .
in a period of un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ent@@ ed population growth and increased food de@@ m@@ and@@ s , this could prove dis@@ a@@ st@@ r@@ ous .
the world presented me with options , and i took them .
our goal is a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of published designs so clear , so complete , that a single bur@@ ned d@@ v@@ d is effectively a civilization star@@ ter k@@ it .
all those things , the eggs , the cy@@ sts , the bacteria , the viruses , all those can travel in one gram of human fe@@ ces .
it &apos;s a wonderful waste dis@@ pos@@ al device .
and you might think it &apos;s just good kar@@ ma to see these guys sti@@ r@@ ring sh@@ it , but it &apos;s also good economic sense , because they &apos;re saving a million dollars a year .
and she was h@@ or@@ ri@@ fied to get there and find that they didn &apos;t have a toilet .
we &apos;re not going to meet t@@ ar@@ gets , providing people with san@@ it@@ ation at this rate .
those re@@ e@@ f@@ s at discovery bay , ja@@ ma@@ ic@@ a were the most studied coral re@@ e@@ f@@ s in the world for 20 years .

we &apos;ve managed to do that in the last 100 to 150 years .
i have talked about it a million times , but it &apos;s unbelievable .
the other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is coral ble@@ ach@@ ing . it &apos;s a beautiful picture , right ?
that doesn &apos;t sell .
and yet , to the best of our knowledge , we are alone .
what did i see ? stars , s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ tes , b@@ lin@@ king air@@ pl@@ an@@ es -- typical sky j@@ un@@ k .
and what would be behind those ru@@ b@@ ber mas@@ ks , if they were ?
first of all , i was em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ sed because i had not read the novel &quot; d@@ un@@ e &quot; at that time .
and it was so successful that they made it into a movie .
now , far@@ o is a bu@@ st@@ ling little city , and to get to the beach , she explained , you would have to take a bus and then a boat .
one of them was named jo@@ se@@ ph , and he asked me what was i doing , and i explained .
so we &apos;re caught in a kind of tra@@ p .
fi@@ r@@ ms produce goods for h@@ ou@@ se@@ holds -- that &apos;s us -- and provide us with in@@ comes , and that &apos;s even better , because we can spend those in@@ comes on more goods and services .
the savings ra@@ ti@@ o , net savings , were below zero in the middle of 2008 , just before the crash .
you can hear the five-@@ year-old mind working .
and in the same to@@ ken , the solution becomes clear , because this isn &apos;t , therefore , about changing human nature .
we have to invest , in fact , in the idea of a meaningful pro@@ sp@@ er@@ ity , providing cap@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ties for people to fl@@ ou@@ r@@ ish .
first of all , economists aren &apos;t supposed to be inspiring , so you may need to work on the t@@ one a little .
i pa@@ in@@ ted it directly on top of the man .
it was about space and light .
this is a photograph from when i vis@@ ited p@@ ru@@ d@@ ho@@ e bay in al@@ as@@ ka in 20@@ 0@@ 2 to watch the min@@ er@@ als management service testing their ability to burn oil sp@@ il@@ l@@ s in ice .
and the other thing it does is it sp@@ re@@ ads out the moment it hits the water .
and that &apos;s actually very per@@ ver@@ se .
and then , of course , there was john d@@ . ro@@ ck@@ e@@ f@@ ell@@ er .
it also put in place the national environmental policy act , the clean air act , the clean water act .
they have degrees in political science , degrees in business -- they &apos;re entrepreneurs . they don &apos;t actually want to be doing what they &apos;re doing .
if you look at people who make $ 50,000 a year , they have two kids , they might have three jobs or more , and then they have to really com@@ mu@@ te .
we need to kind of ra@@ ti@@ on@@ alize this whole thing , and you can find more about this policy .
well , you probably recognize the first person .
and here she rel@@ ates , in the do@@ c@@ um@@ ent@@ ary film &quot; af@@ gh@@ an star , &quot; how her friends ur@@ ged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy .
last year when i was here , i was speaking to you about a swim which i did across the north pole .
i feels like you &apos;ve got a man standing behind you with a ham@@ m@@ er just h@@ it@@ ting your head all the time .
and there , we sat down , and we did a de@@ b@@ ri@@ e@@ f about what had gone wrong there on m@@ t . e@@ ver@@ est .
blog about it , t@@ we@@ et about it , talk about it , and com@@ mit a hundred percent , because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .
this is a state diagram . that &apos;s an extremely simple computer .
can we get self-@@ re@@ p@@ li@@ cat@@ ing-@@ type behavior ?
so what i &apos;m showing you here is that we can make a 2@@ d shape -- the b -- as@@ se@@ m@@ ble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
this is three minutes of u@@ v light .
and if you &apos;ve seen am@@ y s@@ mit@@ h , she talks about how you get students at mit to work with communities in haiti .
and it ten@@ ds to feel a little over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ing when we look at what is there in reality today and the ma@@ g@@ ni@@ tu@@ de of the problem that we face .
increasingly , we &apos;re re@@ ali@@ zing that we don &apos;t even need to den@@ si@@ fy an entire city .
okay . i do too .
do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by , for example , connecting us to ri@@ vers and allowing for re@@ st@@ or@@ ation ?
and , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 6@@ 5,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade , as h@@ or@@ ri@@ fi@@ c as it is .
because we have been doing something right , and it sure would be good to find out what it is .
they like the gener@@ ics .
if not , one or the other needs up@@ gra@@ ding , isn &apos;t it ?
then the developing countries applied so@@ a@@ p and water , v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ ation .
and now i have income per person on this axis .
and then they would remember the first part of last century , which was really bad , and we could go by this so-called great le@@ a@@ p forward .
can you see how it &apos;s growing ? and how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in asia ?
and here were are . we have a con@@ tin@@ u@@ um in the world .
look here . this is the world .
they get safe water , they get food for the poor , and they get malaria er@@ a@@ di@@ c@@ ated .
and we have to f@@ ac@@ t-@@ base the whole way we look at the world .
don &apos;t make it africa . don &apos;t make it a race issue .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and it will not happen around one super@@ power .
a lot of you have heard the term &quot; me@@ m@@ es . &quot; the evolution of technology , i pay a lot of attention to , so , you know , one of the first things you got was a little hand a@@ x@@ e .
the argument i make is basically that , well , non-@@ z@@ er@@ o-@@ sum games have always been part of life .
and that &apos;s pretty new , and i think it &apos;s probably going to get a lot worse -- this capacity -- because of trends in information technology , in technologies that can be used for pur@@ pos@@ es of m@@ uni@@ tions like bi@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ gy and n@@ an@@ ot@@ e@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ gy .
doing the best i can , ok .
&quot; y@@ a@@ h@@ we@@ h is our sa@@ vi@@ or &quot; means &quot; he has saved the nation of israel , &quot; which at the time , was a pretty high-@@ level social organization .
we have civil wars only in six countries , which means that the media are co@@ ver@@ ing only six countries .
so , where should we be putting the money ?
none of those countries , including africa &apos;s most successful nation , bot@@ s@@ w@@ an@@ a , has ever met its qu@@ ot@@ a .
in the process , we , the african people , have been si@@ del@@ ined from the po@@ li@@ cy@@ -@@ making , po@@ li@@ cy@@ -@@ ori@@ ent@@ ation , and po@@ li@@ cy@@ - im@@ ple@@ m@@ ent@@ ation process in our countries .

we &apos;d like to interview you about that . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now , 14 of the disorders are tre@@ at@@ able , two of them actually cur@@ able .
so in the last 10 years and the hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ings of a science of positive psychology , a science of what makes life worth living .
and i believe there are three different -- and i call them different because different inter@@ ven@@ tions build them , it &apos;s possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives .

you don &apos;t have to take it out of your budget .
i should tell you what &apos;s happened with these experiments .
democracy does not require perfect e@@ qu@@ ality , but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life .

and we got that gift back in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s when women entered the labor force .
electricity was also very h@@ el@@ p@@ ful in li@@ ber@@ ating women .
and an amazing fact for te@@ ch@@ no@@ -@@ op@@ ti@@ mi@@ sts is that in the first half of the 20th century , the rate of im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ent of life ex@@ pe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy was three times faster than it was in the second half of the 19th century .
that was an es@@ say i wrote when i was 11 years old and i got a b + .
i have some ones that were long la@@ sting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tion , and it led to a sense of failure .
so , when i look at creativity , i also think that it is this sense or this in@@ ability to re@@ pres@@ s , my looking at as@@ soci@@ ations in pra@@ c@@ tically anything in life .
and it &apos;s what bu@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ ist f@@ is@@ her@@ men say , because they &apos;re not supposed to kill anything .
and you are no@@ tic@@ ing it more often .
and i needed to find something hi@@ st@@ or@@ ically that would match that .
and how are we going to as@@ sign what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a court of law ?
and they have to be in all possibilities , including those i never considered before .
but i want you to for@@ give me when i use these examples because i &apos;m talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do .
now there are ma@@ ga@@ z@@ in@@ es about water .

but you don &apos;t have to be o@@ zz@@ ie o@@ s@@ bor@@ ne -- you don &apos;t have to be super-@@ ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ous to do this .
so what you need to do is figure out who does care .
nine months later i found myself sp@@ ra@@ ying messages in ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r square . the reason for this act was this image that i saw in my new@@ s@@ feed .

most of our cultural her@@ it@@ age has ten@@ ded to look back@@ ward , ro@@ man@@ ti@@ ci@@ zing the past .
the first story that i did for national geographic , where i recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history co@@ ver@@ age , was a story i pro@@ pos@@ ed on har@@ p se@@ als .
these are the li@@ ons and ti@@ gers of the sea .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m somewhat obsessed with sharks -- i wanted to do another , more c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ atory , story about sharks , as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation .
after i left b@@ im@@ in@@ i , i actually learned that this habitat was being bu@@ l@@ l@@ do@@ zed to create a new golf course and res@@ or@@ t .

this was like a biological desert .
and then you look at the out@@ puts and you start measuring what comes out .
so how to break that cycle ?
you need the bacteria to fix ni@@ tro@@ g@@ en , and without those micro@@ organisms , you won &apos;t have any performance at all .

i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist at all , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or some damn fo@@ ol thing , but in any case it &apos;s not part of science .
people always say consciousness is very hard to define .
you cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness .
it &apos;s really a digital computer program running in your brain and that &apos;s what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program .
but we have this per@@ si@@ st@@ ent con@@ fu@@ sion between ob@@ je@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty and sub@@ je@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty as features of reality and ob@@ je@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty and sub@@ je@@ c@@ ti@@ vi@@ ty as features of c@@ la@@ im@@ s .
... don &apos;t you feel ?
but i also meet people who love what they do and couldn &apos;t imagine doing anything else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers do not wear w@@ ri@@ st@@ w@@ at@@ ches .
maybe they go later , not right away .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
i could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard i ble@@ w into it .
but we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model , where each school can be fl@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ h@@ ing tomorrow .
so er@@ e@@ z and i wanted to know more about that .
the reason for that is that the historical record is becoming di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed at a very fast pace .
and she got it , she said , &quot; okay , i see it &apos;s serious .
she was leading a group of students on a pro@@ test in the streets of ran@@ go@@ on .

in fact , chris was worried and said , &quot; look , don &apos;t show them that slide , because they &apos;re just going to think you &apos;re another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn &apos;t do much .
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
and the solution i offer is to the biggest cul@@ pr@@ it in this massive mi@@ st@@ re@@ at@@ ment of the earth by hu@@ man@@ kind , and the res@@ ul@@ ting decline of the bio@@ sphere .
so i ask , &quot; what would move t , technology , from the nu@@ mer@@ ator -- call it t@@ 1 -- where it increases impact , to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator -- call it t@@ 2 -- where it re@@ du@@ ces impact ?
and it has been a powerful mar@@ k@@ et@@ place di@@ ff@@ er@@ en@@ ti@@ ator , increasing sales and pro@@ f@@ its .
we literally ga@@ ined market share .
but about five days later back in at@@ lan@@ ta , i received an email from gl@@ en@@ n thomas , one of my people in the california meeting .
you know , frankly it &apos;s a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being en@@ dan@@ ger@@ ed and possibly dis@@ man@@ t@@ led by technology .
and indeed , do we need anyone to inter@@ medi@@ ate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual di@@ v@@ ine ?
the arts , whatever they do , whenever they call us together , in@@ vi@@ te us to look at our fellow human being with gener@@ o@@ si@@ ty and curiosity .

man@@ che@@ ster cra@@ f@@ t@@ s@@ men &apos;s gu@@ il@@ d is named after my neighborhood .

and we kind of bor@@ ro@@ wed the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um from the cul@@ in@@ ary institute of america , which in their mind is kind of the harvard of cooking schools , and we created a g@@ ou@@ r@@ met co@@ o@@ ks program for w@@ el@@ f@@ are mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city .
what we &apos;ve discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and ex@@ pe@@ c@@ tations and her@@ b@@ ie &apos;s music , and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time .
these were children who the whole world had given up on , who were fl@@ un@@ king out of public school , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of doing with a@@ ff@@ e@@ ction and sunlight and food and good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s worked out pretty good up to this day .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to record the con@@ c@@ er@@ t and i &apos;m going to give you the music , and if you ever choose to sell it , you must sign an ag@@ re@@ em@@ ent that says the money will come back and support the school . &quot;
and that is a room that was built for a woman named n@@ an@@ cy wil@@ son , who recorded that al@@ bu@@ m at our school last christmas .
the brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and i &apos;ll tell you where i made my big mistake .
he came up to me afterwards , he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he &apos;s as@@ se@@ m@@ bl@@ ed a group of people .
bill stri@@ ck@@ land tells a quiet and astonishing t@@ al@@ e of re@@ de@@ m@@ p@@ tion through arts , music , and unlikely par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ ships .
and then the trans@@ du@@ c@@ er then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain , and the result is a re@@ tin@@ al pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic that can produce normal re@@ tin@@ al output .
but there was this li@@ mit@@ ing factor , the issue of the code , and how to make the cells respond better , produce normal res@@ po@@ n@@ ses , and so this was our con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion .
they cover us in an invisible body ar@@ m@@ or that keeps environmental in@@ su@@ l@@ ts out so that we stay healthy .
but when the bacteria grow and double and they &apos;re all par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating in making these molecules , the molecule -- the ex@@ tra@@ c@@ ell@@ ul@@ ar amount of that molecule increases in pro@@ por@@ tion to cell number .
so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .
so this is just a picture -- a micro@@ graph of your skin .
bacteria are incredibly multi@@ -@@ d@@ ru@@ g@@ -@@ resi@@ st@@ ant right now , and that &apos;s because all of the anti@@ bio@@ tics that we use kill bacteria .
what happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors , and they can carry out tasks that they could never ac@@ comp@@ li@@ s@@ h if they simply ac@@ ted as individuals .
it &apos;s a big treat for me to get to come to this conference .
or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them .
but when we think about justice , ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le says , what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth h@@ on@@ or@@ ing and ad@@ mi@@ ring and re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ zing .
what would be your reason ?
char@@ lie , what do you say to war@@ r@@ en ?
here &apos;s how he put it .
so with flu@@ tes , with golf car@@ ts , and even with a fi@@ er@@ c@@ ely con@@ tested question like s@@ am@@ e-@@ sex marriage , ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le has a point .
michael san@@ de@@ l : the lost art of democratic debate
you know , a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
and , i say that that &apos;s fine -- the future of humanity is en@@ ti@@ t@@ led to make that choice .
so then , what do we do about that ?
i &apos;m saying that the rate of im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ent of those ther@@ ap@@ ies will be enough .
i say that &apos;s non@@ sense .
we know that this th@@ res@@ hold exists , because we don &apos;t get a@@ ge@@ -@@ related diseases until we &apos;re in middle age , even though the damage has been ac@@ c@@ um@@ ul@@ ating since before we were born .
so , you know , you &apos;ve got to actually do your hom@@ e@@ work , in order to understand whether this is true .
audience : hello . i read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years .
none of your media got it right .
we care how we make our profit .
they mar@@ ched into the center of re@@ y@@ k@@ ja@@ vi@@ k , and they put women &apos;s issues onto the agenda .
but i can &apos;t give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that i &apos;ve learned from the economists , the e@@ p@@ ide@@ mi@@ ologists and the en@@ vi@@ r@@ on@@ m@@ ent@@ alists .
the health argument is a scary one , and you &apos;ve probably heard part of this argument before .

the second reason is that we killed these things .
so we thought , let &apos;s give it a go .
in those fossil rocks are some amazing animals .
but immediately , the government said , that &apos;s it , let &apos;s get rid of them , and they paid people to s@@ l@@ au@@ gh@@ ter every one that they saw .
it is , sh@@ or@@ t@@ ly , going to think it &apos;s got the u@@ g@@ li@@ est t@@ as@@ man@@ i@@ an devil baby in the world , so maybe it &apos;ll need some help to keep it going .
and the key question for me was to ask peter , has it changed ? and he said no .
what we want to look at is &quot; africa : the next chapter , &quot; and that &apos;s this : a healthy , s@@ m@@ il@@ ing , beautiful african .
but most of all that they are pro@@ du@@ c@@ tively engaged in life , and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen .
how do we combine all this ?
we were on the bi@@ af@@ ran side .
i had to cra@@ w@@ l in between the legs of these people with my sister stra@@ pped on my back , find a way to a window .
you know , we have to use it well .
and many times i don &apos;t see africans working with them .
so our problem right now is , how can we le@@ ver@@ age all this good will that is coming towards our way ?
you are un@@ dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ined . &quot;
we have i@@ bu@@ ku@@ n a@@ wo@@ si@@ ka in nigeria , with the chair company .

and it &apos;s been used since the &apos; 9@@ 0@@ s to study really complex processes .
i &apos;m going to try to con@@ dense this for you .
and then i &apos;m in the control room here , playing back and forth .
so how do you study ra@@ p s@@ ci@@ en@@ ti@@ fi@@ cally ?
you &apos;ve got major c@@ er@@ e@@ b@@ ell@@ ar activity , which is involved in motor co@@ or@@ din@@ ation .
i mean , probability and statistics , it &apos;s the mathematics of games and gam@@ bling .
now this is quite time con@@ su@@ m@@ ing and isn &apos;t the most comfortable process .
but maintain that thought for the entire du@@ ration of the eight seconds .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial ex@@ pres@@ sions can naturally and in@@ tu@@ i@@ tively be used to control an a@@ v@@ at@@ ar or virtual character .
they go bad very quickly if you don &apos;t , and if you don &apos;t have stable power grid , this doesn &apos;t happen , so kids die .
another com@@ ment of es@@ ther &apos;s was that we react when there &apos;s a tragedy like haiti , but that tragedy is on@@ going .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria par@@ as@@ i@@ te and it &apos;s a very interesting cr@@ y@@ st@@ al@@ l@@ ine sub@@ st@@ an@@ ce .
we have every road , every village , every , almost , square inch of ma@@ da@@ g@@ as@@ car .
your b@@ lu@@ -@@ ray player has a very cheap blue laser .
audience : yeah !
an interesting thing is , we kill them all the time ; we &apos;ve never actually gotten the w@@ ings to shut off in mi@@ da@@ i@@ r .
this is the restaurant , ac@@ or@@ n house .
if you can see this orange tree , it &apos;s actually growing in a car ti@@ re , which has been turned inside out and se@@ wn up .
so , water is a very important aspect .
i &apos;ve got metal and earth to come .
the idea is em@@ br@@ y@@ on@@ ic .
they &apos;re not even en@@ jo@@ ying the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal .
as soon as it t@@ ou@@ ches the water , you should hear a sort of sound of running air .
and as soon as we had these two se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces we thought , if this is supposed to be the s@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ est genome of a self-@@ re@@ p@@ li@@ c@@ ating species , could there be even a smaller genome ?
and we knew , once that worked , that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es to do the same with those .
so ac@@ cu@@ ra@@ cy is essential .
and the last one is a richard fe@@ y@@ n@@ man quote : &quot; what i cannot build , i cannot understand . &quot;
but in fact , here in the nor@@ th@@ west , we &apos;re living very close to the real k@@ or@@ an@@ ic idea of par@@ ad@@ ise , defined 3@@ 6 times as &quot; gar@@ den@@ s w@@ at@@ ered by running st@@ re@@ am@@ s . &quot;
and yet the more you add , the more seems to go missing .
and that number 7@@ 2 never appears .
this is the nest of the ma@@ ture colony , and there &apos;s the nest ent@@ r@@ ance .
so this is the colony fo@@ und@@ ed by a queen the previous summer .
the pat@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ers -- that &apos;s supposed to be a ma@@ g@@ ni@@ fying glass -- are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the for@@ a@@ gers are active .
and cu@@ ri@@ ously , and interestingly , it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing .
and the nest ma@@ in@@ ten@@ ance workers just take all the to@@ o@@ th@@ pi@@ cks to the ou@@ ter edge of the nest mo@@ un@@ d and leave them there .
but the for@@ a@@ gers somehow decide not to come out .
and we &apos;ve done experiments that show that that &apos;s because the longer an ant sta@@ ys outside , the more these simple hydro@@ car@@ b@@ ons on its surface change , and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks .
they cover the earth , except for ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a .
so here you are , that the cost of all this to the world is 8@@ 9 million bar@@ rel@@ s of oil , and the cost an@@ nu@@ ally is three trillion dollars .
and we &apos;re doing it with four percent of the population .
that has nothing to do with it .
so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .
and at the time i went into the wind business , natural gas was nine dollars .
why doesn &apos;t that pro@@ spe@@ ct concern you ?
but that only ble@@ w out 500 million .
never had a problem with m@@ es@@ s@@ ing up an a@@ qui@@ f@@ er or anything else .
t@@ b@@ p : i lost 150 million on the wind , okay .
some have 5,000 . many have more .
you had d@@ ot@@ co@@ m fe@@ ver . and you had gold fe@@ ver .
ou@@ r@@ be@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing@@ .@@ com@@ . life &apos;s an event . an@@ no@@ un@@ ce it to the world .
this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built some of the first electric power gener@@ ating stations .
this came in , like , six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing clo@@ gging up a light so@@ ck@@ et .
and one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait , but then the engineers , when they finally did get there , for the third time , they had to call somebody .
so , i &apos;m going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language , and so it &apos;s not going to sound as warm and fu@@ zz@@ y as your average compassion talk .
and there , the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor .
basically it &apos;s just like , if you &apos;re my enemy , if you &apos;re my ri@@ val -- if you &apos;re not my friend , if you &apos;re not in my family -- i &apos;m much less in@@ c@@ lin@@ ed to apply the golden rule to you .
either way , your for@@ t@@ un@@ es add up to zero . that &apos;s a z@@ er@@ o-@@ sum game .
any form of inter@@ de@@ pen@@ den@@ ce , or non-@@ z@@ er@@ o-@@ sum relationship forces you to ac@@ knowledge the humanity of people .
and if you tell them , &quot; well , they think america dis@@ res@@ pe@@ cts them and even wants to d@@ om@@ in@@ ate them , and they hate america .
most disease is cor@@ related with poverty , but in the case of childhood can@@ c@@ ers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ent families .
a child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
because you simply won &apos;t com@@ mit that kind of energy and time if you don &apos;t really care .
so , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
openness isn &apos;t the end .
now , the d@@ om@@ in@@ ant cancer theory would say that there is a single on@@ co@@ gene in a single cancer cell , and it would make you a cancer vi@@ c@@ ti@@ m .
what does that mean ?
we found some go@@ o@@ ey material that had the right ex@@ tra@@ c@@ ell@@ ul@@ ar ma@@ tri@@ x in it , we put the cells in it , and l@@ o and be@@ h@@ old , in about four days , they got re@@ organized and on the right , is what we can make in culture .
and of course , we now ask , where do we go now ?
so i &apos;d like to finish with a poem .
we have a high-@@ pro@@ fi@@ le journalist caught for pla@@ gi@@ ar@@ ism , a young super@@ star writer whose book involves so many made up qu@@ ot@@ es that they &apos;ve pulled it from the sh@@ el@@ ves ; a new york times ex@@ pos@@ é on fake book re@@ vi@@ e@@ ws .
it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but actually they &apos;re all new types of lies .
he wrote very , very positive re@@ vi@@ e@@ ws about himself . surprise , surprise .
they had four good friends of a person judge their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lies that before were said and then gone .
they said how big the ba@@ th@@ room was , or they said , you know , here &apos;s how far shopping is from the hotel .
right there . okay , glass , take a picture .
and also you want something that fre@@ es your eyes .
but it really opened my eyes to how much of my life i spent just se@@ c@@ lu@@ ding away , be it email or social po@@ sts or wh@@ at@@ not , even though it wasn &apos;t really -- there &apos;s nothing really that important or that pres@@ sing .
i read &quot; peter and the w@@ ol@@ f &quot; with this beautiful band from ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard .
and anybody who would turn around i would , sort of , make a be@@ el@@ ine for .
and at least , you know , in my case , because if i just do one thing all the time , i don &apos;t know , i get very , very bor@@ ed . i bor@@ e very easily .
i think of myself as a ... i don &apos;t know what i think of myself as .
do you get nervous , as@@ h@@ l@@ ei@@ g@@ h ?
im : are you fre@@ a@@ king out ? you look so cute .
and again , i don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , i just think it &apos;s not boring , right ?
if you &apos;ve ever over@@ be@@ at@@ en your wh@@ i@@ pped cre@@ am , it &apos;s actually bu@@ t@@ ter@@ milk .
i call it the era of ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en@@ ship -- where people could be from multi@@ -@@ ra@@ ci@@ al , multi@@ -@@ e@@ th@@ ni@@ c back@@ gro@@ un@@ ds , but all be equal as citizens in a state .
eventually i was de@@ te@@ cted , of course , in egypt .
this ni@@ ger@@ i@@ an student studied in london , trained in ye@@ men , bo@@ ar@@ ded a flight in am@@ st@@ er@@ da@@ m to attack america .
there are no ideas and nar@@ ra@@ ti@@ ves and leaders and symbols ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ating the democratic culture on the ground .
an@@ e@@ c@@ d@@ ot@@ ally , we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor , well bin la@@ den is from one of the ri@@ ch@@ est families in s@@ au@@ d@@ i ar@@ ab@@ ia .
what happened there was a political co@@ ali@@ tion ga@@ ther@@ ed together for a political goal , and that was to remove the leader .
these tools don &apos;t get soci@@ ally interesting until they get te@@ ch@@ no@@ lo@@ gi@@ cally boring .
he tra@@ ces the ed@@ ges of the individual networks and then color co@@ des them .
and because of the social connections , chinese students coming elsewhere , and going to school , or businesses in the rest of the world opening o@@ ff@@ ic@@ es in china -- there were people listening all over the world , hearing this news .
and finally the chinese cra@@ cked down .
we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global , social , u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous and cheap .
but having considered it all , i &apos;m still going to vote the way i &apos;m going to vote .
it was on my fourth trip to e@@ ver@@ est that a com@@ et passed over the mountain . hy@@ a@@ k@@ u@@ take .
this is a view looking up the ic@@ e@@ fall , the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp .
and this is at camp four .
and there were cli@@ m@@ ber@@ s on that su@@ m@@ mit ri@@ dge .
we also got some bad news in the storm that be@@ c@@ k wea@@ th@@ ers , another cli@@ m@@ ber , had col@@ la@@ p@@ sed in the snow and was dead .
it &apos;s so a@@ w@@ k@@ ward to work up there that sometimes i even gave the in@@ je@@ ctions right through their clothes .
this cli@@ m@@ ber was snow blind .
and i can only try to spe@@ cu@@ late on how he did it .
and this is how he &apos;s going to turn thought back into action .
these are ser@@ ph@@ as lighting j@@ uni@@ per br@@ an@@ ches .
and the fourth thing , which i believe is most important , is &quot; the ideas that we need to anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , because of the rise of ent@@ re@@ pr@@ en@@ e@@ ur@@ ship , entrepreneurs have become role models , and they are con@@ tri@@ bu@@ ting hu@@ g@@ el@@ y to the society .
it was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal v@@ ot@@ ing and par@@ li@@ am@@ ent and con@@ st@@ it@@ u@@ tion and so forth .
the third thing is again cities .
the second one is the labor policies that we have , which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create st@@ and@@ ar@@ di@@ zed jobs in companies , that 9@@ 3 percent of indian labor is in the un@@ organized sector .
therefore when you are a young country , again you have a chance to put in place a modern pen@@ sion system so that you don &apos;t create en@@ ti@@ t@@ le@@ ment problems as you grow old .
and you must have a clear strategy which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decided to have the el@@ e@@ c@@ tions once again .
and ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless that many people on the left try to hate it , the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message : &quot; the government does not know better . &quot;
and basically they don &apos;t fear the people .
this is why basically you have all this creative mi@@ st@@ r@@ us@@ t between the re@@ pres@@ ent@@ a@@ ti@@ ves and those whom they represent .
for@@ t@@ y-@@ three .
now , each of those co@@ h@@ or@@ ts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison .
so david c@@ am@@ er@@ on &apos;s put 20 million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea .
to@@ by e@@ c@@ c@@ les : invest in social change
i &apos;m working already . &quot;
why is that ? are you too tired to go all the way around ?
even if i &apos;m there with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; gre@@ et@@ ings , jack . sal@@ u@@ tations , jack . &quot;
if you guys haven &apos;t figured it out already , my name &apos;s tom th@@ um , and i &apos;m a be@@ at@@ bo@@ x@@ er , which means all the sounds that you just heard were made entirely using just my voice , and the only thing was my voice .
and last but not least , the one on my right here allows me to loop loop loop loop loop loop loop loop my voice .
but our people had to do some 5,000 different mi@@ x@@ es to get this right , to hit our t@@ ar@@ gets .
don &apos;t listen to the people who say you can &apos;t do this , because anyone can .
on the ri@@ gh@@ t-@@ hand side , you see an ul@@ tr@@ as@@ on@@ ic trans@@ du@@ c@@ er .
and i will give you several examples .
you see the trans@@ du@@ c@@ er , the light blue .
and his wife said , &quot; this is the ha@@ p@@ p@@ i@@ est moment of my life . &quot;
many patients like that favor radiation therapy .
and we have be@@ t@@ ter@@ -@@ th@@ an@@ -@@ surgery results in bre@@ a@@ sts .
he can stop the surgery at any moment .
can@@ al street , i know .
and that &apos;s where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s both a t@@ op@@ -@@ down and a bot@@ t@@ om@@ -up kind of industry .
and so , they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible .
and their jo@@ kes , much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer , really only work within that a@@ es@@ the@@ tic .
it takes lots of la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and lots of court time , and the re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers decided that would be way too expensive .
these are the two main sort of b@@ in@@ ary op@@ positions within the logic of copyright law .
and i really want to thank ver@@ on@@ ic@@ a j@@ au@@ ri@@ qu@@ i for making this very f@@ as@@ hi@@ on@@ able presentation .
one was when i had been dropped off by boat on a remote f@@ j@@ or@@ d , only to find that the ar@@ che@@ ologists i was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found .
now this is something that i think is one of the most qui@@ et@@ ly res@@ i@@ li@@ ent things on the planet .
and there are actually a number or ancient ye@@ ws in ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ y@@ ar@@ ds around the u.k. , but if you do the math , you &apos;ll remember it &apos;s actually the ye@@ w trees that were there first , then the ch@@ ur@@ ches .
this is the c@@ lon@@ al cre@@ o@@ so@@ te bush , which is around 1@@ 2@@ ,000 years old .
it &apos;s my hope that , by going to find these organisms , that i can help draw attention to their remarkable res@@ i@@ li@@ ence and help play a part in in@@ sur@@ ing their continued lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty into the for@@ es@@ e@@ e@@ able future .
let &apos;s set it to something else .
t@@ w@@ ent@@ y years later , cri@@ min@@ als are still using mobile phones , but they &apos;re also building their own mobile phone networks , like this one , which has been de@@ p@@ lo@@ yed in all 3@@ 1 states of mexico by the nar@@ co@@ s .
what did they do with this ?
what could ter@@ r@@ ori@@ sts do today with the technologies available that we have ?
recently , the f@@ b@@ i ar@@ re@@ sted an al q@@ a@@ e@@ da a@@ ff@@ i@@ li@@ ate in the united states , who was planning on using these re@@ m@@ ot@@ e-@@ controlled dr@@ one aircraft to fly c@@ 4 explo@@ si@@ ves into government buildings in the united states .
as we &apos;ve seen here , we &apos;re trans@@ forming ourselves into cy@@ bor@@ gs .
it already has a 70 percent mortality rate if you get it , but it &apos;s hard to get .
they &apos;re killing so many people they can &apos;t even afford to bur@@ y them all in anything but these un@@ mar@@ ked gra@@ ves like this one outside of ci@@ u@@ dad ju@@ ar@@ e@@ z .
but on the other hand , i hear people talking about fear , a sense of ris@@ k-@@ a@@ version .
and tra@@ gi@@ cally , in 19@@ 9@@ 9 , when she was in col@@ om@@ bi@@ a working with the u &apos;@@ w@@ a people , focused on pres@@ er@@ ving their culture and language , she and two colleagues were ab@@ du@@ cted and tor@@ tu@@ red and killed by the far@@ c .
and there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of man@@ i@@ pu@@ la@@ tions than young men .
patient capital is un@@ comfortable for people searching for simple solutions , easy cat@@ e@@ g@@ or@@ ies , because we don &apos;t see profit as a bl@@ un@@ t instrument .
but the whole community , all the different se@@ cts , including sh@@ i &apos;@@ a and sun@@ n@@ i , would sit together and pra@@ y . &quot;
because at the height of the season , at the height of its powers , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , it n@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ h@@ es the world , it re@@ ach@@ es to the hea@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , now let &apos;s look at these three por@@ tra@@ its .
so i tried to do a small good thing for my wife .
why not make a local san@@ it@@ ary pa@@ d for my new wife ?
but here the problem is , one company is making na@@ p@@ k@@ in out of c@@ ot@@ ton . it is working well .
ar@@ un@@ ach@@ al@@ am mur@@ u@@ g@@ an@@ an@@ th@@ am : the thing i saw in my wife &apos;s hand , &quot; why are you using that na@@ sty cl@@ ot@@ h ? &quot;
now 1@@ 10 countries are ac@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ing it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i &apos;ve been back there ever since , for the last seven years .
and i then went and did a huge amount of training , swimming in ic@@ y water , backwards and for@@ wards .
and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and ex@@ p@@ and@@ ed .
and my close friend david , he saw the way i was thinking , and he came up to me and he said , &quot; le@@ wi@@ s , i &apos;ve known you since you were 18 years old .
and to think that in 30 , 40 years they could become extinct .
britain , america , japan , south africa , the congo .
this is about 100 trillion g@@ al@@ l@@ ons of cru@@ de oil still to be developed and produced in the world today .
now that might be the end of the story -- okay , we just replace it all with conventional ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les -- but i think , actually , there &apos;s more to the story than that .
very speci@@ alized material that the ab@@ alone self-@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bles , millions of ab@@ alone , all the time , every day , every year .
and the living self-@@ por@@ tra@@ it series was the idea of basically my being a br@@ us@@ h in the hand of amazing people who would come and i would interview .
but i wanted inter@@ vi@@ e@@ ws that were different .
in fact , the first person i inter@@ vi@@ e@@ wed was george ab@@ bot@@ t , who was 9@@ 7 , and ab@@ bot@@ t was filled with the life force -- i guess that &apos;s the way i think about it -- filled with it .
we know the great lines , we know the great moments , we know what we &apos;re not going to share , and the point of this was not to em@@ bar@@ r@@ as@@ s anybody .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t this ar@@ m@@ -@@ w@@ re@@ st@@ le , but it was a little surprising for the person involved .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . &quot; he said , &quot; i understand that . &quot;
half of her body was stri@@ ck@@ en , the other half not .
so this is a new@@ born in@@ ten@@ sive care unit in ka@@ th@@ m@@ and@@ u , ne@@ p@@ al .
i don &apos;t want to make beautiful stuff .
there &apos;s one way to treat ja@@ un@@ di@@ ce , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called an exchange trans@@ fu@@ sion .
it &apos;s not the painting we would have pa@@ in@@ ted , it &apos;s the painting that we actually pa@@ in@@ ted .
another example : again , silly mom .
thank you .
no , we are talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the s@@ wi@@ s@@ s bank ac@@ co@@ un@@ ts , on the bank ac@@ co@@ un@@ ts of li@@ e@@ ch@@ ten@@ st@@ ei@@ n , of the president &apos;s min@@ i@@ sters , the high o@@ ff@@ i@@ ci@@ als in the par@@ a-@@ stat@@ al se@@ ctors .
they even ap@@ pl@@ au@@ d it .
most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bri@@ ber@@ y and so on .
if you think about going into a restaurant , when you look at the men@@ u , are you expected to order every single thing on the men@@ u ?
and it was the first time i &apos;d ever thought that the expression on her face is actually re@@ fle@@ cting how she feels about him .
well , he com@@ par@@ t@@ m@@ ent@@ ali@@ zes his life .
he &apos;s an 18@@ th-@@ century french pa@@ in@@ ter best known for his still li@@ f@@ es , but he did oc@@ c@@ as@@ i@@ on@@ ally paint people .
so unfortunately , this or@@ ph@@ an sp@@ ends most of his time in st@@ or@@ age , along with quite a number of other or@@ ph@@ ans , some of them some beautiful paintings .
i first wor@@ e it at an el@@ ab@@ or@@ ate dinner her parents held in our honor .
&quot; con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ la@@ tions on your up@@ coming nu@@ p@@ ti@@ als , james .
my father also lived most of his adult life in east africa .
i would like to show you six minutes .
lan@@ c@@ el@@ o@@ t i@@ ma@@ s@@ en : but our films , they are stories that our people can relate to themselves .
for a young man to really make it out here , you got to think of some negative things and all that , or some kind of vi@@ ces .
f@@ r@@ an@@ co s@@ ac@@ ch@@ i : so many things to say , so little time .
and i think this is really the theme of this session .
f@@ r@@ an@@ co , you described this as the world &apos;s third largest film industry .
it &apos;s a c@@ d basically . it &apos;s a comp@@ act dis@@ c .
but here comes the art cri@@ tic . oh , that was fantastic .
i think this was truly fantastic .
you know , video games can be truly deep even when they &apos;re completely min@@ d@@ less .
so we have por@@ t@@ al because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces .
so time , space , a@@ es@@ the@@ tics , and then , most important , behavior .
along the way , i &apos;ve had to burn a few ch@@ a@@ ir@@ s . you know ?
and it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt den@@ i@@ ed a place .
and i made some sk@@ et@@ ches on na@@ p@@ k@@ in@@ s -- little boxes and mor@@ an@@ di@@ -like things that i used to do .
and it &apos;s one of the ni@@ c@@ est pieces i &apos;ve ever made , i think .
this beautiful object , the s@@ wi@@ s@@ s army k@@ ni@@ f@@ e , which i get credit for par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating in .
and one day i had a -- oh , well , the other way .
i used the g@@ al@@ v@@ ani@@ ze and c@@ op@@ per in a very light g@@ au@@ ge , so it would bu@@ ck@@ le .
and that &apos;s my c@@ af@@ e@@ ter@@ i@@ a .
and it re@@ min@@ ded me why i play de@@ f@@ en@@ si@@ vely in things like my house .
it &apos;s never been finished .
the d@@ om@@ e was a re@@ qu@@ est from the cli@@ ent .
and so it was an in@@ t@@ ent to make this small piece of land -- it &apos;s 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an e@@ state by se@@ par@@ ating these areas and making the living room and din@@ ing room into this pa@@ vi@@ li@@ on with a high space in it .
they call it the plan c@@ ou@@ pe .
there it is .
and from the building in the back , you see it as an ic@@ e@@ berg floating by in the h@@ il@@ l@@ s .
our cli@@ ent doesn &apos;t want bal@@ con@@ ies , so -- and when we met our new ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ ci@@ an , he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape .
in bar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a i was asked to do a fish , and we &apos;re working on that , at the foot of a ri@@ t@@ z@@ -@@ car@@ l@@ ton tower being done by sk@@ i@@ d@@ more , o@@ w@@ ings and mer@@ ri@@ l@@ l .
can &apos;t we make c@@ le@@ an@@ er burning cooking fuels ?
and one of the things that they found was they didn &apos;t burn .
and these are the bri@@ qu@@ et@@ tes that we made .
and he &apos;s looked at the problem of the health im@@ p@@ ac@@ ts of burning wood versus char@@ coal .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , if this were india , in this room , only three of us would have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward .
there &apos;s a de@@ fin@@ i@@ te difference .
after surgery , everything nor@@ m@@ ali@@ zes .
well that &apos;s not surprising , but we also asked them to judge them on h@@ on@@ e@@ st@@ y , intelligence , fri@@ end@@ lin@@ ess , violence .
he got married . he had a son called j@@ er@@ e@@ mi@@ ah .
is this business about ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ance and pre@@ oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tion with it a western phenomenon ?
i now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do -- where we &apos;re at and where we &apos;re going .
we can replace the under@@ lying sk@@ el@@ et@@ al structure , but we &apos;re still not good at re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ing the facial skin .
my thing with school lunch is , it &apos;s a social justice issue .
and then we talk about organic food .
i mean , people to@@ ss around sustainability , but we have to figure out what sustainability is .
you know that everybody thinks they should be eating more , and more , and more .
and that they could figure it out , that we could sell this stuff to kids .
so this is a typical men@@ u .
you know , the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important , we have to teach kids about in school .
we need to e@@ du@@ c@@ ate the staff .
that 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 4@@ 9 cents -- that &apos;s what the government allo@@ c@@ ates for lunch .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day .
when i go to a party and people ask me what do i do and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; their eyes g@@ la@@ ze over .
i want to shake your confidence that you know your own in@@ n@@ er@@ most minds -- that you are , y@@ ourselves , au@@ th@@ or@@ it@@ ative about your own consciousness .
don &apos;t take the th@@ ri@@ l@@ l of it away . i &apos;d rather be my@@ sti@@ fied .
it &apos;s a fe@@ at@@ u@@ re-@@ length do@@ c@@ um@@ ent@@ ary on consciousness .
and i thought as i got closer i would be able to see all the detail of most people , see their clothes , and so forth .
how do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
can you get it ? how many of you can &apos;t get it ? that &apos;ll help .
we &apos;re going to start easy . some examples .
je@@ ff ha@@ w@@ k@@ in@@ s , this morning , was des@@ cri@@ bing his attempt to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neuroscience .
and the urban pl@@ an@@ ner in london goes , &quot; what do you mean , who &apos;s in charge of london &apos;s — i mean , no one is in charge . &quot;
now , con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on char@@ ges were introduced in sto@@ ck@@ h@@ ol@@ m on january 3 , 2006 , and the first picture here is a picture of sto@@ ck@@ h@@ ol@@ m , one of the typical streets , january 2 .
well , so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services , and tried to figure out who changed , and where did they go ?
then i have been walking east for 20 years -- from eastern europe to central asia -- through the c@@ au@@ cas@@ us mountains , middle east , north africa , russia .
what do we know about the death th@@ re@@ ats by the t@@ al@@ i@@ b@@ an na@@ iled on the do@@ ors of the people who d@@ are to send their d@@ au@@ gh@@ ters to school as in bal@@ k@@ h ?
the world was changing .
i was at the office ; my desk was clean ; i had the blue par@@ ti@@ tion car@@ pe@@ t on the walls .
and there were actually two of these .
it was really something .
how amazing is that ?
now i want to talk b@@ ri@@ e@@ fly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized it re@@ min@@ ded me of google earth , where you can fly to any address .
we are , you are , the most under@@ used resource in health care .
so se@@ a@@ water reverse o@@ smo@@ sis is a me@@ m@@ br@@ an@@ e-@@ fil@@ tra@@ tion technology .
so , ma@@ g@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent creature , isn &apos;t it ?
they do not per@@ c@@ ei@@ ve their environment using sound , and these are the flying fo@@ x@@ es .
and for one year in the u.s. alone , it &apos;s e@@ sti@@ ma@@ ted that it &apos;s going to cost 22 billion u.s. dollars , if we remove bat@@ s . so indeed , bat@@ s then do bring us wealth .
so why should we be interested in aging at all ?
so tonight , when you walk out of here and you look up in the night sk@@ ies , and you see this beautiful flying ma@@ m@@ ma@@ l , i want you to smile . thank you .
europe had to be dra@@ g@@ ged into economic development .
the com@@ mo@@ di@@ ty bo@@ om@@ s are pu@@ m@@ p@@ ing un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ent@@ ed amounts of money into many , though not all , of the countries of the bottom billion .
so , what goes wrong ? why is there this &quot; resource cur@@ se , &quot; as it &apos;s called ?
and so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong che@@ cks and bal@@ ances .
just in time , a set of economists got there and said , &quot; why not try an au@@ ction ? it &apos;ll re@@ ve@@ al the value . &quot;
around the world right now , one billion people are tra@@ pped in poor or failing countries . how can we help them ? economist paul col@@ li@@ er la@@ ys out a b@@ old , com@@ passionate plan for clo@@ sing the gap between rich and poor .
there are no little tan@@ ks where we &apos;re making sur@@ ge@@ ons .
so here &apos;s al@@ l@@ an teaching an en@@ g@@ li@@ sh@@ -@@ speaking surgeon in africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do min@@ im@@ ally inv@@ as@@ i@@ ve surgery .
so here &apos;s what we think we want to do : imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language si@@ mul@@ tan@@ e@@ ously .
f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ als of la@@ par@@ o@@ sc@@ op@@ ic surgery .
f@@ ou@@ r@@ te@@ en years ago , i first en@@ counter@@ ed this ordinary material , f@@ is@@ h@@ net , used the same way for centuries .
he asked if i could build this as a permanent piece for the city .
so we ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent@@ ed with tiny at@@ om@@ ized water particles to create a dry m@@ ist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting we@@ t .
there they were in their business su@@ its , la@@ ying in the grass , no@@ tic@@ ing the changing patterns of wind b@@ es@@ i@@ de people they didn &apos;t know , sharing the re@@ discovery of wonder .
and that also brought me to the fact that this pos@@ es such a risk to our society .
when peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the f@@ un@@ c@@ ti@@ on@@ ing of peter &apos;s mind taking place .
when you do , what do you want to control ?
and to say that such changes can per@@ s@@ ist after death is itself a f@@ actual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
now , let me be clear about what i &apos;m not saying . i &apos;m not saying that science is gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every con@@ c@@ ei@@ vable moral question .
now , why wouldn &apos;t this under@@ mine an ob@@ je@@ ctive morality ?
what are the chan@@ ces that represents a peak of human fl@@ ou@@ r@@ is@@ h@@ ing ?
on the left you have ed@@ ward wi@@ t@@ ten .
we live in a world filled with de@@ st@@ ru@@ ctive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ invented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
but again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what is the natural enemy , the bi@@ ol@@ o@@ gi@@ cally controlled ag@@ ent , or the good bu@@ g , that we are talking about ?
here we are talking a par@@ as@@ i@@ te -- not a two-@@ le@@ g@@ ged par@@ as@@ i@@ te , this is a par@@ as@@ i@@ tic w@@ as@@ p , again , two m@@ il@@ li@@ meters long , s@@ len@@ der , a very quick and sharp fli@@ er .
and if we spread those minute pi@@ rate bu@@ gs , the good ones , for example , in a sweet pe@@ p@@ p@@ er plot , they go to the flowers .
for example , in israel , where we em@@ p@@ lo@@ y more than 1,000 he@@ ct@@ ar@@ es -- 10,000 d@@ un@@ am@@ s in is@@ ra@@ el@@ i terms -- of biological p@@ est controlling sweet pe@@ p@@ p@@ er under protection , 75 percent of the pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des were actually reduced .
and th@@ ir@@ dly , also to increase awareness by the gro@@ w@@ er@@ s to the potential of this industry .
au@@ t@@ om@@ o@@ tive retro@@ fu@@ tur@@ ism is one of my speci@@ al@@ ties .
the bra@@ in@@ less rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody . i do a lot of that .
urban ab@@ sur@@ dis@@ m -- that &apos;s what the new y@@ or@@ ker really calls for .
her former name was fa@@ y w@@ ray , and so that was -- i didn &apos;t have the wi@@ t to say , &quot; take the painting . &quot;
or again , the collapse of the soviet union took place within a couple of decades , maybe within a decade , of the time when the soviet union was at its greatest power .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really e@@ ats insects .
they &apos;re at the start of food ch@@ a@@ ins .
in fact , why would we put these b@@ al@@ l@@ s in the s@@ ou@@ p , there &apos;s meat in there anyway ?
it &apos;s 25 ki@@ lo@@ gra@@ ms per person per year .
so far we &apos;re taking the one , or up to five ki@@ lo@@ gra@@ ms of output .
we can increase it a bit at the ex@@ pen@@ se of ra@@ in@@ forests , but there &apos;s a li@@ mit@@ ation very soon .
and some might think , well they &apos;re not yet available .
al@@ li@@ son h@@ un@@ t : my three minutes hasn &apos;t started yet , has it ?
so he said , &quot; al@@ li@@ son , we &apos;ve got to get you on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even when a can@@ a@@ di@@ an che@@ ats the system , they do it in a way that benefits society .
and in this book , little le@@ wi@@ s would know the big idea .
this is a rule device . and on the back are some other devices , measuring tools and scales , to be able to make some cal@@ cu@@ la@@ tions . okay ?
right . so , that &apos;s how the device is used .
there is a quality of cra@@ f@@ t@@ s@@ man@@ ship and pre@@ c@@ is@@ i@@ on that is just astonishing and remarkable .
so , the first robot to talk about is called stri@@ der .
this is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sen@@ s@@ ors -- because it is tall , it &apos;s 1.@@ 8 meters tall -- you can see over ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les like b@@ us@@ hes and those kinds of things .
for example , in this case , even though the left and right wheel is connected with a single a@@ x@@ le ro@@ t@@ at@@ ing at the same angle of v@@ el@@ o@@ city .
welcome to ro@@ m@@ el@@ a , the ro@@ bo@@ tics me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms laboratory at vi@@ r@@ g@@ in@@ i@@ a tech .
but the cool part is the user interface .
let &apos;s see how it does . this was our very first trial , and ... spe@@ c@@ t@@ at@@ ors : goal !
so , what is the secret of our success ?
but just a spar@@ k of imagination is not good enough .
so , education is very important .
it &apos;s down@@ to@@ w@@ ns becoming g@@ host to@@ w@@ ns .
there &apos;s basically no pool of qu@@ ali@@ fied teachers to pull from , and only eight percent of the people in the co@@ un@@ ty have a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree or higher .
there is a total vacuum of creative capital in ber@@ tie co@@ un@@ ty .
so the goal is to have all of your te@@ am@@ ma@@ tes sitting on the ti@@ r@@ es and then your team w@@ ins .
and in recent decades , a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely .
and going out into the community and inter@@ vi@@ e@@ wing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that &apos;s a hom@@ e@@ work as@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ment .
on those , it is almost impossible to create vast areas of b@@ are ground .
and i want to in@@ vi@@ te you now to come along on my journey of re@@ education and discovery .
it has just come through four months of rain , and it &apos;s now going into eight months of dry season .
let &apos;s look at some results .
what we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as , i believe , fossil fuels , and maybe more than fossil fuels .
so when i heard these two things , it tr@@ ou@@ bl@@ ed me deeply , both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons .
it has a very well-@@ e@@ qui@@ pped pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ c op@@ h@@ th@@ al@@ mic center , which was made possible in part by a gift from the r@@ on@@ al@@ d mc@@ don@@ al@@ d charity .
after treatment , about every week , we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line .
the answer lies in motion and that &apos;s what i want to show you in the next clip .
i had to have long conversations with my wife .
so we are pur@@ su@@ ing this line of work and hopefully we &apos;ll have more results to report soon .
and i heard that they do these track me@@ ets with all dis@@ ab@@ led r@@ un@@ ners , and i figured , &quot; oh , i don &apos;t know about this , but before i judge it , let me go see what it &apos;s all about . &quot;
that was fall of &apos; 95 . but then , by the time that winter was ro@@ l@@ l@@ ing around , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then a@@ i@@ me@@ e makes it to the 19@@ 9@@ 6 par@@ al@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ics , and she &apos;s all excited . her family &apos;s coming down -- it &apos;s a big deal .
i tried to get it out of anybody i could , you know , &quot; who am i running against here ? &quot;
if i had won everything -- but it was like , what was the point ?
you can be eight feet tall . just take them off . &quot;
mo@@ der@@ ator : a@@ i@@ me@@ e and the designer of them will be at te@@ d@@ med 2 , and we &apos;ll talk about the design of them .
they got someone to come in and saw off the shoes .
but i@@ den@@ ti@@ fying the actual lo@@ s@@ ses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math .
or about 7@@ 5,000 jobs .
and another thing about math : math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example here -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- like &quot; am i dr@@ un@@ k ? &quot;
in math education , we &apos;re spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand .
people say , &quot; is such and such true ? &quot;
but au@@ to@@ ma@@ tion in cars allowed that to separate , so driving is now a quite separate subject , so to speak , from engineering of the car or learning how to service it .
all backwards .
but i think we can do both at the same time here .
and one of the reasons it &apos;s so important -- so it &apos;s very important to get computers in ex@@ am@@ s .
it was the winter of 2009 , and i had been blind for about a year .
in particular , i thought about my dad , who had passed away from comp@@ li@@ ca@@ tions from brain surgery .
si@@ m@@ il@@ ar@@ ly , just through the gri@@ p of the can@@ e , you can feel contra@@ sting te@@ x@@ tures in the floor below , and over time you build a pattern of where you are and where you &apos;re headed .
but once i lost my sight and was walking along bro@@ ad@@ way , i was bl@@ es@@ s@@ ed every block of the way .
if you design a city with the blind in mind , there &apos;ll be jobs , lots of jobs .
to give you a sense of the experience , the article was called , &quot; i think you &apos;re fat . &quot;
and they range from the famous ones that i had heard of -- the ten com@@ m@@ and@@ ments , love your neighbor , be f@@ ru@@ it@@ ful and multi@@ p@@ ly .
you don@@ ate money to a cause , and you become e@@ mo@@ ti@@ on@@ ally involved in that cause .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and came down from on high .
so , this is actually a key to happiness for me , is to just remember when i came over here , the car didn &apos;t flip over , and i didn &apos;t trip coming up the sta@@ ir@@ s .
so , this was very inspiring to me .
so if we are to find any meaning in this book , then we have to really engage it , and w@@ re@@ st@@ le with it .
so we &apos;ve got that incredible ra@@ m@@ p@@ -up .
the ac@@ a@@ de@@ mi@@ cs who were over@@ seeing this work thought that that was too fri@@ v@@ ol@@ ous , so we built de@@ ad@@ ly serious applications like this op@@ tics pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ ing work@@ ben@@ ch in which a to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ st@@ e cap on a car@@ d@@ board box becomes a laser .
but al@@ e@@ x was pre@@ par@@ ing a little , sort of ob@@ sc@@ ure , in@@ die , ar@@ th@@ ou@@ se film called &quot; min@@ or@@ ity report &quot; for ste@@ v@@ en sp@@ i@@ el@@ berg , and invited us to come out from mit and design the inter@@ faces that would appear in that film .
and we &apos;ll perform this bo@@ o@@ le@@ an operation because we really love yellow and ta@@ p@@ ir@@ s on green grass .
let &apos;s pull this apart : i &apos;ll go ahead and explo@@ de it .
we &apos;re , as human beings , the creatures that create , and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image .
john , thank you for making s@@ ci@@ en@@ ce@@ -@@ fiction real .
now what o@@ k@@ ol@@ lo@@ h did would not have been possible without digital technology .
but here &apos;s the thing : the stu@@ pi@@ des@@ t possible creative act is still a creative act .
but the group of da@@ y@@ care centers represented by the black line , they said , &quot; we are changing this bar@@ gain as of right now .
it &apos;s value created by the par@@ ti@@ ci@@ pan@@ ts for each other .
and like all good so@@ ap@@ s , it j@@ um@@ ps 20 years when the audience interest changes .
you don &apos;t always have five days . so , we moved on , and we started playing 5@@ 0@@ -@@ over cri@@ ck@@ et .
india didn &apos;t want to play the t@@ 20 world cup .
the other was indian cri@@ ck@@ et .
this was the new india , wasn &apos;t it ? this was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price .
we &apos;d all seen mat@@ ches in k@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a , but we &apos;d never seen anything like this : sha@@ h ru@@ k@@ h , with the ben@@ g@@ al@@ i song , getting the au@@ di@@ en@@ ces all worked up for k@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a -- not for india , but for k@@ ol@@ k@@ at@@ a .
could you have imagined that day would come ?
hopefully , it &apos;ll make everyone richer , hopefully it &apos;ll make the game bigger and hopefully it &apos;ll give cri@@ ck@@ et com@@ m@@ ent@@ ators more time in the business .
and the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly re@@ vi@@ e@@ wed in memory the times you &apos;ve seen dogs and p@@ ig@@ s on le@@ as@@ hes .
why in the world would anybody ever play the l@@ ot@@ ter@@ y ?
on the other hand , if you &apos;re vis@@ it@@ ing an under@@ developed country , and 25 dollars bu@@ ys you a g@@ ou@@ r@@ met meal , it &apos;s ex@@ or@@ b@@ it@@ ant for a big ma@@ c .
would you spend your re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing 20 dollars on a ti@@ ck@@ et ?
let me just give you an example .
and if a drive across town is worth 100 bu@@ cks , it &apos;s worth 100 bu@@ cks no matter what you &apos;re saving it on . people don &apos;t think that way .
well , by and large people are en@@ or@@ m@@ ously im@@ patient .
watch what happens when we drop some out .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more on this . so , you &apos;re saying that our response to ter@@ ro@@ r is , i mean , it &apos;s a form of mental bu@@ g ?
there are no g@@ un@@ s going off .
and as a result , many people look at economists as stupid people .
&apos;@@ theme and v@@ ari@@ ations &apos; is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity , because you are always com@@ par@@ ing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind .
and this was the text -- &quot; in words as fashion the same rule will hold / ali@@ ke fantastic if too new or old / be not the first by whom the new are tried / nor yet the last to lay the old aside . &quot;
and one day i wo@@ ke up and i said , &quot; well , suppose that &apos;s not true ? &quot;
one is the sort of wi@@ l@@ l@@ ing@@ ness to ex@@ pos@@ e myself to a critical audience , and not to suggest that i am con@@ fi@@ dent about what i &apos;m doing .
my in@@ t@@ ent is to have a li@@ ter@@ ary ac@@ comp@@ an@@ im@@ ent that explains the poster , in case you don &apos;t get it .
so by and large , they are good for our survival .
je@@ ws often have an un@@ ple@@ as@@ ant s@@ we@@ e@@ ti@@ s@@ h o@@ d@@ or .
when the room s@@ m@@ elled gro@@ ss , what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des toward gay men .
i feel like i &apos;m coming home to talk about what i &apos;ve been away doing for 20 years .
mar@@ c@@ us : it fe@@ e@@ ds my mind and my soul .
w@@ 1 : they su@@ ck .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends -- fellow fil@@ m@@ makers -- talking about what c@@ in@@ em@@ a means .
without food -- i was sick .
we don &apos;t need no more trouble get that i@@ di@@ o@@ t out !
our government was cor@@ ru@@ p@@ t .
so for me , the thought that we have all these children -- it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children -- who have been put through so much psychological tr@@ au@@ ma or damage , and africa has to live with that .
and throughout the book , there &apos;s over an hour of do@@ c@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fo@@ ot@@ age and interactive an@@ i@@ ma@@ tions .
what is the business here ?
and it didn &apos;t seem , at least , that your sell ou@@ ts , whatever they were , were very big .
so , i thought , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s probably a good idea . &quot;
they &apos;re still talking about it .
when i came out of college , i started to try to do things con@@ te@@ x@@ tu@@ ally in southern california , and you got into the logic of sp@@ an@@ ish col@@ oni@@ al ti@@ le ro@@ o@@ f@@ s and things like that .
r@@ s@@ w : what &apos;s his s@@ ch@@ e@@ du@@ le on that ?
the mit project -- they were inter@@ vi@@ e@@ wing me for mit and they sent their f@@ ac@@ i@@ li@@ ties people to b@@ il@@ ba@@ o .
that &apos;s what re@@ min@@ ded me of it .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; now what can i do for you , mr. ge@@ h@@ r@@ y ? &quot;
walk around for four months with three wi@@ sh@@ es , and all the ideas will start to per@@ col@@ ate up .
and i think one of the things i also wanted to say in my thanks , which i kind of missed , was to thank all the cor@@ po@@ ra@@ tions who helped me get in .
but in the me@@ an@@ time , these things are sc@@ al@@ ing up .
and this is like 10 weeks later , de@@ mo@@ li@@ shed by hand .
you &apos;re seeing the tu@@ x@@ e@@ do@@ s , the b@@ ou@@ qu@@ ets .
the kinds of col@@ li@@ sions of st@@ y@@ les and things were quite something , and these are called the vi@@ l@@ l@@ as .
it &apos;s an incredibly massive operation , i think 1@@ 5@@ ,000 workers , five cu@@ po@@ l@@ as , and the si@@ x@@ th one &apos;s coming in here .
this floor has about 1,@@ 500 workers on this floor .
fi@@ f@@ ty percent of the world &apos;s computers end up in china to be re@@ cy@@ cl@@ ed .
what was unusual , according to ste@@ p@@ h@@ en , is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image .
and wish three is : i@@ ma@@ x film . so i was told i should do one for myself , and i &apos;ve always wanted to actually get involved with doing something .
and it &apos;s becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste st@@ re@@ am@@ s .
so the traditional ways of se@@ par@@ ating materials just simply don &apos;t work for pla@@ st@@ ics .
the traditional way to make pla@@ st@@ ics is with oil or pet@@ ro@@ chemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic com@@ pos@@ i@@ te : many different types of pla@@ st@@ ics and many different gra@@ des of pla@@ st@@ ics .
now i &apos;m seeing lots of s@@ mi@@ r@@ ks out there .
and what we see is that people tend to keep making er@@ r@@ ors exactly the same way , over and over again .
maybe we should look at monkey &apos;s economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of du@@ m@@ b things that we do .
here &apos;s may@@ day . she &apos;s going to be tra@@ ding a to@@ ken for some food and waiting ha@@ p@@ p@@ i@@ ly and getting her food .
she &apos;s waiting for the market to open a little im@@ pa@@ ti@@ ently .
so imagine that right now i hand@@ ed each and every one of you a thousand u.s. dollars -- so 10 c@@ ris@@ p hundred dollar b@@ il@@ ls .
you can either take a ris@@ ky loss -- so i &apos;ll flip a co@@ in . if it comes up heads , you &apos;re going to actually lose a lot .
if we set up those same sc@@ en@@ ari@@ os in our little monkey market , would they do the same thing as people ?
they guy on the left is a safe loss .
you know , maybe it &apos;s not just humans at the right side of this chain that &apos;s d@@ un@@ ce@@ y .
and here &apos;s the ru@@ b .
but the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on earth .
we need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger , and what we &apos;ve been working on is 3@@ 0@@ -@@ story tall buildings made of wood .
that &apos;s the equivalent of about 9@@ 0@@ 0 cars removed from the road in one year .
bomb bl@@ as@@ t cur@@ ta@@ ins covered my windows .
we might even call them citizens , because they &apos;ve recently ris@@ en up to fight against le@@ g@@ is@@ la@@ tive in@@ cur@@ sion , and the citizens of these networks work together to serve each other in great ways .
s@@ ber@@ bank , the largest and oldest bank in russia , largely owned by the r@@ us@@ si@@ an government , has started pra@@ c@@ tic@@ ing cro@@ w@@ d@@ s@@ ou@@ r@@ cing , engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations .
we &apos;ve heard talk here at ted about people bio@@ ha@@ cking and ha@@ cking their plants with ar@@ du@@ in@@ o , and mo@@ z@@ il@@ l@@ a is doing work around the world in getting young people to build we@@ b@@ sites and make videos .
and so , i came to think that ma@@ ma e@@ ter@@ n@@ al , ma@@ ma e@@ ter@@ n@@ al , is always wondering : are all the children in ?
now that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to give a message , and they each read in their own language a central a@@ ff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tion , and that was some version of the golden rule : &quot; as you would that others would do un@@ to you , do also un@@ to them . &quot;
to be a pa@@ st@@ or is to care for these individual needs .
and we &apos;re doing this through some case studies .
there are over 1@@ 80 em@@ bas@@ si@@ es in washington d@@ .@@ c.
it &apos;s already taken up by landscape and by sc@@ ul@@ p@@ tures .
it &apos;s made of sil@@ con@@ -@@ co@@ ated glass fiber .
there are also some re@@ stri@@ ctions about how much it could be li@@ t .
the bubble is an anti-@@ mon@@ um@@ ent .
i saw my a@@ un@@ t in ra@@ pe when i was only five .
one of the journey that i tre@@ ad when i was te@@ m@@ p@@ ted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around 400 .
as a child so young and ten@@ der , words i can &apos;t forget i still remember .
that &apos;s my story shared in the form of a lesson .
so my bre@@ a@@ k@@ fast , my lunch , i don@@ ate it to a charity that i fo@@ und@@ ed because we want to build a school in su@@ d@@ an .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yes !
the third chapter is an even more complicated legal pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ding known as a federal h@@ ab@@ e@@ as cor@@ pu@@ s pro@@ ce@@ e@@ ding .
it means that it &apos;s in the low 60 percent .
the way we solve this problem is to make the issue of the death pen@@ al@@ ty bigger .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not yet too late .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t remember anything from when i was five years old .
i mean , s@@ ant@@ a cl@@ au@@ s knows if you &apos;re n@@ au@@ gh@@ ty or nice , right ? &quot;
but , j@@ ul@@ ie , you were so ready to start school , h@@ on@@ ey . you were so ready . &quot;
and they looked at each other and s@@ m@@ il@@ ed , like that was the right answer . and then they said , &quot; do you believe that we &apos;re all brothers and si@@ sters on this planet ? &quot;
maybe their greater ability to co@@ operate and adapt ?
i think this film is one of the har@@ des@@ t w@@ at@@ ches of modern times , &quot; the road . &quot;
in the second world war , we needed to produce a lot of stuff .
but we have to remember that there &apos;s a fundamental input to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s resources we use .
but now for the good news !
it might be latin american .
and i think this is where climate change s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics and den@@ i@@ ers come in .
we did a project for the government office of science a couple of years ago , a big program called the for@@ es@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge t@@ om@@ e .
you tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people .
as they went from the first building to the second , each of them passed a man who was b@@ ent over and mo@@ an@@ ing , clearly in need . the question is : did they stop to help ?
the word is &quot; pi@@ zz@@ led &quot; : it &apos;s a combination of pu@@ zz@@ led and p@@ is@@ sed off .
there &apos;s a wonderful book called stuff : the hidden life of everyday objects .
since then -- it &apos;s been four decades now -- i &apos;ve trained with the best in the field , per@@ formed across the globe , taught young and old ali@@ ke , created , c@@ ol@@ l@@ ab@@ or@@ ated , ch@@ or@@ e@@ o@@ gra@@ ph@@ ed , and wo@@ ve a rich ta@@ pe@@ st@@ r@@ y of ar@@ ti@@ st@@ r@@ y , ach@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ em@@ ent and a@@ wards .
and i found that in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my very life breath .
i dan@@ ced between ch@@ em@@ o and radiation cy@@ c@@ les and b@@ ad@@ ger@@ ed him to fit it to my performing dance s@@ ch@@ e@@ du@@ le .
well , it was basically f@@ ru@@ stra@@ tion .
that &apos;s what it was like then .
he had put it together , combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he &apos;d put it into this software , which i think his son developed , originally , and produces this wonderful presentation .
well , in those do@@ c@@ um@@ ents , there are little squ@@ ar@@ es , little boxes .
well , i &apos;d like to suggest that rather -- yes , make a beautiful website , who am i to say don &apos;t make a beautiful website ?
you ask the linked data -- which they &apos;ve now put together -- 32 hits , each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at .
and that is what linked data is all about .
and combined , this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year , last year , than in the year 2000 .
and if we are , are we ready to i@@ ter@@ ate , monitor and provide feedback , make sure these pro@@ mis@@ es are really de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing results ?
you just put up , just as one of your numbers there , that 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started giving me a few ti@@ ps about drawing and painting .
and that fascinated me , to explore that ter@@ ri@@ t@@ ory .
how many of you saw a cow crossing in india while you were coming from b@@ an@@ g@@ al@@ ore to my@@ sor@@ e ?
it &apos;s just that being a human , the way we train to per@@ c@@ ei@@ ve the reality creates this meaning .
they said , &quot; of course .
can you make something from nothing as a sc@@ ul@@ p@@ t@@ or ? &quot;
so this is a cor@@ ru@@ g@@ ated box and its sha@@ do@@ w .
because when we see someone walks , we see the footprint .
what percentage of that was ac@@ co@@ un@@ ted for by foreign direct investment ?
he &apos;s clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
so foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of w@@ ra@@ pping up here , because if you think about it , what i &apos;ve been talking about today is this notion -- very un@@ con@@ tro@@ ver@@ si@@ al amongst economists -- that most things are very hom@@ e-@@ bi@@ as@@ ed .
this is the community that i originally showed you the slide of .
getting a little more technical now .
think about to@@ y@@ ot@@ a .
you can &apos;t fight it , so embrace it and find a way to work with it .
and it &apos;s very difficult to t@@ un@@ e .
it &apos;s com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive . it &apos;s go@@ al-@@ di@@ re@@ cted .
well , you have pi@@ zz@@ a when you &apos;re hungry for pi@@ zz@@ a .
there &apos;s a million different t@@ op@@ p@@ ings .
so remember , when we &apos;re thinking about se@@ x@@ u@@ ality education and sexual activity , bas@@ e@@ ball , you &apos;re out .
and it goes like this . it &apos;s by a guy called y@@ u@@ an ch@@ en : &quot; i cannot bear to put away the b@@ am@@ bo@@ o sleeping m@@ at .
it was : &quot; what percentage of the day and night do you think about this person ? &quot;
in over 17@@ 5 societies , people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system .
they came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal .
and , indeed , they &apos;re becoming a very powerful force .
and i say , &quot; why do you think more men are ad@@ ul@@ ter@@ ous than women ? &quot;
not at any time on this planet have women been so educated , so interesting , so capable .
she &apos;s 23 . she &apos;s been on them ever since she was 13 .
it got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another .
they &apos;re going to survive as long as our species sur@@ vi@@ ves on what sha@@ k@@ es@@ pe@@ are called &quot; this mor@@ t@@ al co@@ il . &quot;
but i actually do .
now , most researchers believe obesity is the cause of in@@ su@@ li@@ n resistance .
maybe we should be asking ourselves , is it possible that in@@ su@@ li@@ n resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity , at least in most people ?
others think it &apos;s too much di@@ et@@ ary fat .
peter at@@ ti@@ a : is the obesity crisis hi@@ ding a bigger problem ?
but my great grandfather , h@@ en@@ ry ford , really believed that the mission of the ford motor company was to make people &apos;s lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them .
and the good news is today we are tac@@ k@@ l@@ ing the big issues , of cars and the environment -- not only at ford , but really as an industry .
well i think you probably already have the picture .
but what really in@@ sp@@ ir@@ es me is what &apos;s going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other .
and we must have an infrastructure that &apos;s designed to support this fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble future .
this is a minute 5@@ 9 .
i think my mother now thinks that i &apos;m some sort of inter@@ i@@ or de@@ cor@@ ator .
they &apos;ll ask the nurses to input data .
this stuff is really important . this stuff is really vital . &quot;
so , what came out of this ?
and for us , it &apos;s been great because it &apos;s won lo@@ ads of design a@@ wards .
i got infected when i was 17 , when , as a student of the design college , i en@@ counter@@ ed adults who actually believed in my ideas , ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ged me and had lots of cu@@ ps of ch@@ a@@ i with me .
it was about all children . so , we were sh@@ am@@ eless .
we basically gave children a very simple challenge .
for our au@@ ction we have some wonderful paintings for you , for a very good cause , the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids .
but what i never said , and what i &apos;m really going to make the point is , that really , green is cool .
probably su@@ m@@ m@@ ed up in a way by the st@@ y@@ li@@ s@@ h or alternative available here , as we gener@@ ously had gi@@ f@@ ted at l@@ un@@ ch@@ time , the &#91; unclear &#93; , which is a further kind of development -- and again , inspired by the incredible sort of sen@@ su@@ al feel .
so , if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities , which took 200 years , then that same process is happening in 20 years .
it anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated change , even though those changes were not known .
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
i mean , a 9@@ 4 percent reduction -- virtually clean .
and how do we make more le@@ gi@@ ble in this growing world , especially in some of the places that i &apos;m talking about -- china , for example , which in the next ten years will create 400 new air@@ por@@ ts .
and i think that is the qu@@ in@@ t@@ essence of this 18@@ -@@ minute talk -- that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness .
as opposed to the first office that i showed you in the beginning of the talk , this is a well-@@ known office , which is the white group .
and behind them , you see that se@@ ag@@ ra@@ m building that later turned into an ic@@ on of modern lighting design .
and , i mean , that is quite amazing , what you see here -- how much light goes up into the sky and never re@@ ach@@ es the ground .
now this is not very ple@@ as@@ ant and comfortable .
they are not di@@ st@@ ur@@ bed anymore .
when our home minister an@@ no@@ un@@ ces a few weeks ago a war on one third of india , about 200 di@@ stri@@ cts that he mentioned were un@@ go@@ ver@@ n@@ able , he missed the point .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home , maybe i saw a h@@ on@@ ey bee or it occurred to my mind that if i only could be like the h@@ on@@ ey bee , life would be wonderful .
an@@ il gu@@ p@@ t@@ a : but what has it been used for ? what has it been used for ?
doing what ? breaking stones , di@@ g@@ ging earth .
that &apos;s the only space she could express her creativity .
they don &apos;t want se@@ con@@ d-@@ standard , se@@ con@@ d-@@ quality out@@ puts .
and that is what man@@ su@@ k@@ h b@@ ha@@ i pra@@ ja@@ pat@@ i has done .
i had to meet my love .
mr. k@@ har@@ a@@ i who is a physically ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ged person , one and a half foot height , only .
as@@ sa@@ m , k@@ an@@ ak go@@ go@@ i .
that &apos;s re@@ as@@ sur@@ ing .
that &apos;s 3@@ .@@ 2 billion people .
or sk@@ i@@ ing . it &apos;s just fun , and people love to move around doing fun things .
so we &apos;ve been working really , really hard , but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an at@@ ti@@ tu@@ de about what &apos;s important , and how to apply the technology .
cars were not meant for parallel parking ; they &apos;re wonderful machines to go between cities , but just think about it : we &apos;ve solved all the long-@@ range , high-@@ speed problems .
so if we put this box on here in a few years , could we have a solution to transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe dr@@ in@@ k@@ able water in a sustainable p@@ ac@@ ka@@ ge that w@@ ei@@ gh@@ s 60 pounds ?
im@@ p@@ li@@ c@@ it@@ ly or ex@@ p@@ li@@ c@@ it@@ ly , there is a narrative that all the people who are dying were somehow involved in the drug trade , and we in@@ f@@ er this because they were either tor@@ tu@@ red or ex@@ e@@ cu@@ ted in a professional man@@ ner , or , most likely , both .
you will read that los z@@ et@@ as is this as@@ sor@@ t@@ ment of soci@@ op@@ a@@ ths that ter@@ ri@@ fy the cities that they enter and they silence the press , and this is somewhat true , or mostly true .
and the me@@ x@@ i@@ can borders , but now they have grown into a truly integrated mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional that has par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ ships in production in the south and par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ ships in global distribution across the planet .
but also it &apos;s part of being any mon@@ th@@ ly magazine -- you live in the future . and we have a long le@@ ad@@ -@@ time .
after it falls below a critical price , it will tend , if it &apos;s successful , to rise above a critical mass , a pen@@ et@@ ration .
but they &apos;re getting very , very cheap , and look at the interesting im@@ p@@ li@@ cation of it . as they get cheaper , the pre@@ mi@@ um br@@ and@@ s , the son@@ ys and such , are losing market share , and the no@@ -@@ names , the a@@ pe@@ x@@ es , are ga@@ in@@ ing them .
if you look here , here &apos;s lin@@ u@@ x in red , and it &apos;s hit 20 percent .
free is really , you know , the gift of silicon valley to the world .
because of some of technologies we &apos;ve been talking about .
patient capital works between , and tries to take the best of both .
second , it had to be extremely affordable .
president obama under@@ stands that .
because one of the poorest farmers on earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life .
and yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been h@@ on@@ or@@ ed throughout the generations .
during the h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e , you had m@@ s@@ n@@ b@@ c po@@ sting about the h@@ ur@@ ri@@ can@@ e on their blog , up@@ d@@ at@@ ing it fre@@ qu@@ ently . this was possible because of the easy nature of b@@ lo@@ g@@ ging tools .
i like music , and i like ban@@ jo@@ s , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , &quot; i could do that . &quot;
i wrote this one , and i put this up because of einstein today .
and you see this post .
and just these little things .
and i &apos;ll probably get ch@@ o@@ ked up , because i tend to when i talk about this .
it was f@@ is@@ hed su@@ sta@@ in@@ ably till all of time , except for our generation .
and we &apos;ve got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works .
we &apos;d been studying these fish , but first we had to learn how to h@@ us@@ b@@ and@@ ry them .
but that &apos;s about half the size of the biggest t@@ un@@ a we &apos;ve ever ta@@ g@@ ged .
they &apos;re coming together . that could be t@@ un@@ a sex -- and there it is .
they can throw out a target -- it &apos;s a car@@ pe@@ t shaped like a se@@ al -- and in will come a white shark , a curious cri@@ t@@ ter that will come right up to our 16@@ -@@ f@@ t@@ . boat .
and then for sort of an en@@ core from these animals , they &apos;re helping us .
we can save the white shark .
and i don &apos;t think he was ex@@ pe@@ cting me to have such de@@ ta@@ iled records of what i did .
but they said , &quot; okay , aside from what we had dis@@ c@@ us@@ sed , do you bel@@ on@@ g to any groups that wish to harm the united states ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy or your resources .
now if you go to my bank records , it &apos;ll actually show something from there , so you know that , on may 9@@ th , that i bought $ 14@@ .@@ 7@@ 9 in fuel from sa@@ fe@@ way val@@ le@@ j@@ o .
so i ti@@ me@@ -@@ st@@ am@@ p my life every few moments .
when i first started this project , people were looking at me and saying , &quot; why would you want to tell everybody what you &apos;re doing , where you &apos;re at ?
so it &apos;s just become another day .
now let me show you these heat maps of paris to see how in@@ san@@ ely fast it &apos;s growing .
now , i &apos;ve looked at thousands of these mar@@ k@@ et@@ places , and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients .
how do we mi@@ mic the way trust is built f@@ ac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face online ?
i was essentially a g@@ host in the system .
this site re@@ c@@ ei@@ ves five and a half thousand questions a day , and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers .
i want to start though with a par@@ a@@ do@@ x .
and there , you see it in rel@@ ation to the measure of ine@@ quality i &apos;ve just shown you , which i shall use over and over again in the data .
we did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a separate test bed , we re@@ pe@@ ated it all on the 50 american states -- asking just the same question : do the more un@@ equal states do worse on all these kinds of me@@ as@@ ur@@ es ?
ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ari@@ ly da@@ ma@@ ging , if you &apos;re talking about using the t@@ al@@ ents of the population .
and in our analysis of the american states , we find rather the same contrast .
the soci@@ al-@@ e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ative ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments increase , the fear of those soci@@ al-@@ e@@ v@@ al@@ u@@ ative ju@@ d@@ g@@ ments .
or for instance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more un@@ equal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on .
there &apos;s over three million am@@ pu@@ te@@ es every year who need a new or re@@ pl@@ ac@@ em@@ ent knee .
you remember ka@@ ma@@ l earlier , holding the b@@ am@@ bo@@ o staff .
so if you &apos;re wearing it under pan@@ ts or a sk@@ ir@@ t or a s@@ ar@@ i , it &apos;s really obvious that you &apos;re wearing a pro@@ s@@ the@@ tic limb , and in societies where there &apos;s social st@@ ig@@ ma around being dis@@ ab@@ led , people are particularly ac@@ ute about this .
so thank you .
you want a dirty magazine ?
in fact , i bought the g@@ ol@@ d-@@ pl@@ ated special edi@@ tion and it comes with a little sli@@ p of paper that says , &quot; don &apos;t use this ju@@ ic@@ er to make ju@@ ice . &quot;
this is one through 20 . next , &quot; they just give you as many o &apos;s as there are pages .
intense fear par@@ al@@ y@@ zes you .
but in fact , if that &apos;s how you always were you &apos;d never get any work done because you &apos;d be working along and say , &quot; oh , i got a new way of doing it . &quot;
almost everything we do is sub@@ conscious .
it &apos;s being safe in the world .
if that am@@ u@@ se@@ ment park were ru@@ sty and falling apart , you &apos;d never go on the ride .
i mean , this is a very small sample ; you should not gener@@ alize from it .
i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-@@ organization , and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like .
and by the evening of that day , 70 children were all bro@@ w@@ sing .
so , i could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover pra@@ c@@ tically the whole world .
what you have , actually , is there is one child operating the computer .
natural systems are all self-@@ or@@ g@@ an@@ i@@ zing : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies -- except for the debate about an intelligent designer .
and it &apos;s about re@@ dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ing ide@@ alism in all of that w@@ re@@ ck@@ age .
i bought myself a nice suit and wor@@ e le@@ a@@ ther@@ -@@ sol@@ ed shoes and re@@ v@@ el@@ ed in this amazing access i had to world events .
but in 20@@ 0@@ 2 , when my tour came to an end , i decided i wasn &apos;t going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in london .
i felt just something &apos;s broken .
and i went through it . i went through those mo@@ bs .
and i came to ko@@ so@@ v@@ o and ad@@ vis@@ ed the ko@@ so@@ v@@ o government .
independent di@@ pl@@ om@@ at is part of a trend which is emerging and e@@ vi@@ dent across the world , which is that the world is fra@@ g@@ m@@ ent@@ ing .
this is terrible that you don &apos;t con@@ su@@ lt these people who are actually affected .
that is the politics of the 21st century , and in a way , independent di@@ pl@@ om@@ at em@@ bodies that fra@@ g@@ m@@ ent@@ ation , that change , that is happening to all of us .
and you say , &quot; hey , could you bring the sk@@ im milk ? &quot;
because back to the whole relationship issue , what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you &apos;re not , or it can remind me of why i should love you .
we feel a@@ we , we feel p@@ ity .
okay , here we go .
what &apos;s number one ?
no . in the 70s you have the b@@ ell@@ we@@ ther show &quot; the bi@@ on@@ ic woman &quot; that ro@@ ck@@ et@@ ed into the t@@ op@@ -@@ 10 in 19@@ 7@@ 3 , followed by the &quot; six m@@ il@@ li@@ on-@@ dollar man &quot; and &quot; char@@ lie &apos;s an@@ g@@ el@@ s . &quot;
i can vote you off the island .
and so i &apos;m so excited to dis@@ c@@ us@@ s this with them , and i come in and i say , &quot; can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool ? &quot;
the next thing is , that virus dna made stuff that ch@@ op@@ p@@ ed up the bacteria dna .
well , there were a couple of reasons .
or even worse , science education is becoming like that guy who always says , &quot; actually . &quot;
there &apos;s still so much work left to be done , though , and if you &apos;re involved with science in any way i ur@@ ge you to join me .
we climb the sta@@ ir@@ case and experience a state of al@@ ter@@ ed consciousness .
so many books about war say the same thing , that nothing brings people together like war .
d@@ ur@@ k@@ h@@ ei@@ m believed that anything that un@@ ites us takes on an air of s@@ ac@@ re@@ dness .
he went on to say that &quot; s@@ el@@ fish and con@@ ten@@ ti@@ ous people will not co@@ here , and without co@@ her@@ ence nothing can be e@@ ff@@ e@@ cted . &quot;
it takes advantage of the others .
once they were all in the same tri@@ be , they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside .
it &apos;s about jo@@ in@@ ing with others to pur@@ su@@ e moral ideas .
j@@ h : thank you .
i soon realized that man@@ spaces didn &apos;t have to be only inside .
and right off the gar@@ age he has his own tro@@ ph@@ y room where he can sort of bas@@ k in his ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments , which is another sort of important part about a man@@ space .
everything &apos;s gotten si@@ m@@ pl@@ er in design , and here &apos;s this me@@ g@@ a airport , and god , i just -- i took a picture .
and &quot; the end of print &quot; is now in its fifth printing .
and so this book is called &quot; pro@@ b@@ es . &quot; it &apos;s another word for qu@@ ot@@ es .
this is an experiment , really , for a cli@@ ent , qui@@ ck@@ sil@@ ver , where we were taking what was a si@@ x@@ -@@ shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the web .
they thought some people didn &apos;t like them .
article on br@@ y@@ an fer@@ ry -- just really boring article -- so i set the whole article in d@@ ing@@ b@@ at .
somebody told me today there was this thing called f@@ ol@@ ders , but i don &apos;t know what they are .
that &apos;s pretty high for most oc@@ cu@@ pa@@ tions .
before that , obviously , technology didn &apos;t exist . but obviously it did .
this is not on another planet . these are things that are hidden away on our planet .
and the last thing , i bring back this nu@@ di@@ br@@ an@@ ch .
this is ni@@ les el@@ d@@ re@@ dge . he was the co-@@ de@@ v@@ el@@ op@@ er with ste@@ p@@ h@@ en ja@@ y g@@ ou@@ l@@ d of the theory of pun@@ c@@ tu@@ ated e@@ qu@@ i@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
we &apos;ve heard about the japanese giving up g@@ un@@ s .
and i think it &apos;s really important . because if you can imagine mo@@ z@@ art before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be .
i first became fascinated with o@@ ct@@ op@@ us at an early age .
he re@@ ach@@ es up , takes another ar@@ m@@ ful of gra@@ v@@ el , r@@ el@@ e@@ ases it -- ch@@ k ch@@ k ch@@ k ch@@ k ch@@ k ! -- same thing .
but the idea is , we were there for a month and i wanted to ac@@ climate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without di@@ st@@ ur@@ bing them .
and as you go deeper , that lovely , blue water you were launched in gives way to dar@@ ker and dar@@ ker blue .
but down there , there is no sun , there is no photo@@ sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is ; it &apos;s che@@ mo@@ synthetic environment down there driving it , and it &apos;s all so e@@ p@@ he@@ mer@@ al .
but , en@@ c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ ingly , i &apos;ve seen just the opposite .
and everybody is talking to everyone else -- it &apos;s not is@@ ol@@ ated points on a map anymore , it &apos;s a network we &apos;ve created .
she was a hom@@ e@@ ma@@ ker , but she and i didn &apos;t go out and do gi@@ r@@ lie things together , and she didn &apos;t buy me p@@ ink out@@ f@@ its .
my parents got di@@ v@@ or@@ ced , and my sister was ar@@ re@@ sted .
cities are the cru@@ ci@@ ble of civilization .
is e@@ din@@ bur@@ g@@ h a horse ?
this is what our whole economy is th@@ ru@@ sting upon us , particularly il@@ lu@@ st@@ r@@ ated in that le@@ f@@ t@@ -@@ hand corner : ho@@ ck@@ ey sticks .
heart rates are s@@ lo@@ w@@ er ; you live longer ; di@@ ff@@ u@@ sion of oxygen and resources across me@@ m@@ br@@ an@@ es is s@@ lo@@ w@@ er , etc .
but most important in this , the ex@@ po@@ n@@ ent , the an@@ al@@ o@@ g to that three-@@ quar@@ ters for the me@@ t@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ c rate , is bigger than one -- it &apos;s about 1.@@ 15 to 1.@@ 2 .
you grow fast and then stop -- part of our res@@ i@@ li@@ ence .
that &apos;s what we like , ho@@ ck@@ ey sticks .
kids in the 1@@ 2@@ th grade : not exactly all that en@@ th@@ u@@ si@@ a@@ stic about the american government system .
and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us .
my students produced these in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year res@@ po@@ n@@ ding to the oil sp@@ il@@ l .
this is one of my favorite photos , because this was taken on tu@@ es@@ day , when i asked the students to go to the po@@ l@@ l@@ s .
and this is just the same .
and you can actually -- -- we won &apos;t get into that .
it &apos;s a wild concept .
and he asked a very important question .
and i &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
you see the cells coming back out .
many of those patients are very se@@ ver@@ ely bur@@ ned .
the european union , same thing .
and while i don &apos;t have any pat@@ ents that i &apos;m aware of , you will be meeting a few of my inv@@ en@@ tions today .
and you know what that means , of course .
and you &apos;ve all made these ad@@ van@@ c@@ em@@ ents happen in such a short time -- you &apos;re all so young .
thank you everybody .
at my school -- actually i was part of co-@@ fo@@ und@@ ing an organization , which is like a leadership thing , you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything .
you know , she was very ch@@ ic , but she was very filled with en@@ nu@@ i , you know .
my daughter -- my daughter wrote that , she told me , &quot; always start your speech with humor . &quot;
i am les@@ bi@@ an . &quot;
i want to hold your hand .
and finally , i get a call last year , and then i have to go up after j@@ .@@ j@@ . ab@@ ra@@ ms .
and it struck me that if i could write stories that were about this world as being small and inter@@ connected , that maybe i could get people interested in the issues that affected us all , and maybe engage them to make a difference .
and john said , &quot; bet on good people doing good things .
and there really wasn &apos;t a specific company that was focused on the public interest .
i thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem .
and one thing that i &apos;ve learned is that there &apos;s never one right way to make change .
so , tell me , how many po@@ li@@ ce@@ men do you think are on this ta@@ x@@ i ? and now ? three .
now , have a look at that . that &apos;s the an@@ es@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ology machine .
yes , that &apos;s the medical advice the com@@ mit@@ te@@ e ch@@ a@@ ir@@ man says , &quot; yes , i told you , you weren &apos;t going to be able to , you can &apos;t do this , i just know it . &quot;
here is our very first patient , out of in@@ ten@@ sive care , and just watch that chair , all right ?
these are the basic features of my device , or our device .
i have to serve . &quot;
this is in the sc@@ ot@@ ti@@ s@@ h par@@ li@@ am@@ ent .
they put her on very special nu@@ tri@@ ti@@ ous diet and took great care of her .
his app wasn &apos;t rein@@ st@@ ated until he won the pu@@ li@@ t@@ z@@ er prize .
but there &apos;s been a lot of debate in t@@ un@@ is@@ i@@ a about how to handle this kind of problem .
so we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is medi@@ ated through the internet , which is com@@ pris@@ ed pri@@ mar@@ i@@ ly of pri@@ v@@ at@@ ely owned and op@@ er@@ ated services .
re@@ be@@ c@@ ca ma@@ ck@@ in@@ n@@ on : let &apos;s take back the internet !
they used to win the gold me@@ d@@ als in w@@ ei@@ gh@@ t@@ li@@ f@@ ting and w@@ re@@ st@@ ling , every four years in the ol@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ ics , and they were the great c@@ el@@ e@@ bri@@ ties of com@@ m@@ un@@ ism , with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it .
the european union , which by now was beginning to re@@ a@@ p the benefits of globalization , trans@@ forming it into the most a@@ ff@@ lu@@ ent consumer market in history , eventually com@@ pris@@ ing some 500 million people .
from 19@@ 9@@ 4 , for seven years , 20 of these bo@@ ats made the trip across the ad@@ ri@@ a@@ tic , from mon@@ ten@@ e@@ gr@@ o to it@@ al@@ y , every single night .
let me go on to the 10@@ 1 of international organized crime now .
i would like to introduce you to mr. pr@@ ing@@ le .
they affect our bank ac@@ co@@ un@@ ts .
i mean -- if i &apos;m a good dar@@ win@@ ist , i &apos;ve got to believe there &apos;s a reason for that .
it made him very un@@ popular . they didn &apos;t want to go back to square one .
it had been waiting there since 1960 when ali@@ ster har@@ dy , a marine bi@@ ol@@ o@@ g@@ ist , said , &quot; i think what happened , perhaps our ancestors had a more a@@ qu@@ a@@ tic existence for some of the time . &quot;
as an absolute connection , it only works one way .
and then again , there is the fact that we are st@@ re@@ am@@ lin@@ ed .
there was professor to@@ bias . he &apos;s come over .
so if it &apos;s going to come and it &apos;s going to happen , what &apos;s holding it up ?
one -- i want to speak as early in the morning as possible .
yeah , i was hanging out with some google guys last night .
you can kind of pe@@ er into other people &apos;s lives , and i also feel like i get a lot of inspiration from the average user .
this is called &quot; a@@ th@@ ei@@ st . &quot;
online drawing tools -- you &apos;ve probably seen a lot of them .
per@@ for@@ m@@ er and web to@@ y@@ maker ze frank de@@ li@@ vers a h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous n@@ er@@ d@@ core st@@ and@@ up r@@ out@@ ine , then tells us what he &apos;s seriously passionate about : helping people create and interact using simple , ad@@ di@@ ctive web tools .
and the answer is rather strange .
so , in par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph number four , you &apos;re going to tell people , &quot; if no one is providing you with this information , let me help . &quot;
and so an@@ y@@ time i talk about what i do , i like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter .
so this particular device is called the gut li@@ st@@ en@@ er .
they &apos;re both s@@ h@@ r@@ in@@ king and re@@ treating -- and some of them have disappeared al@@ together .
that actually wouldn &apos;t be such a problem , because if we were really all going to die , we would put aside our differences , we &apos;d spend whatever it took , and we &apos;d find a way to de@@ fle@@ ct them .
this is data from the con@@ gr@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al budget office showing its most re@@ ali@@ stic for@@ e@@ c@@ as@@ t of what would happen if current situations and ex@@ pe@@ c@@ tations and trends are ex@@ ten@@ ded .
it &apos;s a s@@ ac@@ red rock , and when people circle something together , they uni@@ te , they can trust each other , they become one .
it &apos;s so that the b@@ lo@@ o@@ ds and the cri@@ ps will know which side to vote for .
so for a lot of reasons , those decades after the second world war were an hi@@ st@@ or@@ ically an@@ om@@ al@@ ous time .
this is where we are as a country .
we are becoming a nation of just two classes .
now this is a social disaster , and li@@ ber@@ als are very concerned about this .
but they don &apos;t exist . so i &apos;m having to make them .
they &apos;ve been in use , in architecture , since ancient times .
so , you can see from these di@@ ag@@ ra@@ ms that the pro@@ to@@ cell is actually moving away from the light , toward the dark fo@@ un@@ da@@ tions .
in fact , i &apos;ve managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades , perhaps my pr@@ ou@@ des@@ t ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment .
instead , i &apos;m a ch@@ a@@ i@@ red professor of law , psychology and p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ry at the us@@ c g@@ ou@@ l@@ d school of law , i have many close friends and i have a bel@@ o@@ ved husband , will , who &apos;s here with us today .
qu@@ ot@@ ing from my w@@ ri@@ t@@ ings : &quot; my two c@@ l@@ as@@ s@@ ma@@ tes , re@@ be@@ l and val , and i had made the date to meet in the law school library on fri@@ day night to work on our me@@ m@@ o as@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ment together .
then they stra@@ pped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick le@@ a@@ ther stra@@ ps .
i &apos;ve never met a p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c patient who agreed with that view .
i could get you ad@@ mit@@ ted right away , and the whole thing could be very dis@@ cre@@ te . &apos; &apos; ha , ha , ha .
american pris@@ ons and ja@@ ils are filled with people who suffer from severe mental illness , and many of them are there because they never received a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate treatment .
so we decided at stanford to build a different self-@@ driving car .
this is four billion hours wa@@ sted in this country alone .
in short , there was a lot of water and there weren &apos;t very many people .
now the bre@@ w@@ er@@ s in mon@@ tan@@ a have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption , but they still use millions of g@@ al@@ l@@ ons of water .
he gets paid to leave the water in the stream .
i don &apos;t like to ac@@ knowledge a problem without also ac@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ging those who work to fix it , so just wanted to ac@@ knowledge shows like &quot; mad men , &quot; movies like &quot; bri@@ des@@ ma@@ i@@ ds , &quot; whose female characters or pro@@ ta@@ g@@ oni@@ sts are complex , multi@@ f@@ ac@@ et@@ ed .
his name is mat@@ th@@ i@@ e@@ u ri@@ card .
i know there are other com@@ passionate companies in the world , but google is the place i &apos;m familiar with because i &apos;ve been there for 10 years , so i &apos;ll use google as the case study .
so it turns out that google is a com@@ passionate company , because go@@ o@@ gl@@ ers found compassion to be fun .
i mean , you come to work in the morning , and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in india .
it works in three steps .
and i hope that compassion will be both fun and pro@@ f@@ it@@ able for you too .
but one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a ve@@ ge@@ table s@@ ell@@ er , she was sitting outside of a house .
i met with one of the development a@@ gen@@ cies , and they were training pro@@ se@@ cu@@ t@@ ors and ju@@ d@@ ges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to de@@ f@@ en@@ ders .
and people often say to me , &quot; you know , this is great , but it &apos;s wil@@ dly ide@@ ali@@ stic .
and in the same kind of tr@@ ance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in new york when you &apos;re reading , there &apos;s something really so@@ o@@ thing and easy .
different parts of the world have a k@@ n@@ ac@@ k for different things .
and at the same time , the g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous work of ta@@ k@@ es@@ hi is@@ hi@@ g@@ ur@@ o , who did these beautiful sal@@ t-@@ and@@ -@@ pe@@ p@@ p@@ er con@@ ta@@ in@@ ers that are made of rice d@@ ou@@ g@@ h .
but it r@@ an@@ ge@@ d from such it@@ em@@ s as a complete de@@ -@@ mining equipment to these kind of w@@ at@@ er@@ -@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ li@@ zing stra@@ ws , so it was really wi@@ de@@ -@@ ran@@ ging .
even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your im@@ print , all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by an@@ a mi@@ r in bar@@ c@@ el@@ on@@ a .
so what &apos;s image got do with it ?
and they ad@@ op@@ ted a very interesting approach to education , which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford .
final story , and i sort of have to speak quickly .
and he died when the am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce was coming to the hospital to take him .
b@@ lo@@ g@@ ging is one way of doing that .
you know , just jump .
and we as africans need to start challenging our leaders .
my c@@ ou@@ s@@ in ran out of school fe@@ es , and she &apos;s really smart .
and if they don &apos;t admit you , they &apos;re the ones who are m@@ es@@ s@@ ed up . &quot;
for years , the country has been divided between politics and religion .
so did our political problems .
chan@@ ge@@ -@@ makers and future leaders have been created .
he was out there in par@@ ol de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing a baby .
she is really the center of the health care system .
i &apos;m just going to sell these to every clinic in the world .
now , when i got this , i was -- press cap@@ s lo@@ ck -- absolutely fre@@ a@@ k@@ ed out , okay ?
now ri@@ ley &apos;s going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here .
and you can see that life ex@@ pe@@ ct@@ an@@ cy was also short .
li@@ f@@ es@@ p@@ an has increased to 7@@ 8 .
this is the best technology that this region could ever have : des@@ al@@ ination .
let &apos;s start with the water .
but you need to share it with the world . okay ?
it seems that generation e@@ p@@ sil@@ on is coming .
you have 100,000 people in a non@@ violent march , and one i@@ di@@ o@@ t or ag@@ ent pro@@ vo@@ cat@@ eu@@ r is th@@ ro@@ wing stones , guess what takes all the cameras ? that one guy .
and then it &apos;s about humor . humor is such a powerful gam@@ e-@@ chan@@ ger , and of course it was very big in po@@ land .
well , million dollar question : what will happen in the arab world ?
and she said , &quot; i saw your talk li@@ v@@ e-@@ st@@ re@@ am@@ ed .
i said , &quot; if 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000 , my life is over . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more vulnerable than that .
and i see you .
and everybody just bur@@ st into ap@@ pl@@ au@@ se , and they were like &quot; yes ! &quot;
i know your dad really wasn &apos;t in lu@@ x@@ em@@ b@@ ou@@ r@@ g , he was in sing sing .
the other thing you need to know about shame is it &apos;s absolutely organized by gender .
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
we want to be with you and across from you .
and if we now beat up and down ...
if an ant fell into my rice , i couldn &apos;t see that either .
this helped us build a very ethical and very highly pa@@ ti@@ ent@@ -@@ c@@ ent@@ ri@@ c organization and systems that support it .
we kind of changed the simple digital camera into a re@@ tin@@ al camera , and then every patient gets their t@@ el@@ e@@ con@@ su@@ l@@ tation with a doctor .
the re@@ ven@@ u@@ es increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy mar@@ g@@ in while you &apos;re treating a large number of people for free .
there are a bit harder issues .
for example , we can au@@ g@@ ment digital content with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive ?
it was as if they couldn &apos;t see me anymore , as if an inv@@ is@@ i@@ bility clo@@ ak had des@@ c@@ en@@ ded .
and the other thing is , that because nobody &apos;s seen or heard of an underwater wh@@ e@@ el@@ chair before , and creating this spe@@ ct@@ ac@@ le is about creating new ways of seeing , being and knowing , now you have this concept in your mind .
as with b@@ p , the hole does get pl@@ u@@ g@@ ged , at least te@@ m@@ por@@ ari@@ ly , but not before ex@@ ac@@ ting a tremendous price .
don &apos;t feel as@@ ham@@ ed .
and it &apos;s also the story of modern capitalism , because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system , one that cannot survive without per@@ pet@@ u@@ al growth and an un@@ ending supply of new f@@ r@@ on@@ ti@@ ers .
the oil is not liquid .
now , you may have noticed more and more head@@ lines like these .
nice show . man , that was good !
bf : also three with his left .
dh : all right , please stand here in front ...
r@@ w : do i get to hold them ?
dh : just do it ju@@ g@@ gl@@ er boys , you say ?
dh : then here we go .
dh : the french judge ...
dh : i got that -- to reach down and grab that club in my gri@@ p of steel .
bf : from six to seven . dh : that &apos;s a world &apos;s record . bf : really ? dh : for us .
he &apos;s less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them .
yet if you did , you would see something very , very similar to this .
this is actually from one of -- the paper that she trans@@ l@@ ated .
so there are plans .
you know the problem ; we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
second ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ li@@ e@@ t , s@@ as@@ s@@ i and pan@@ no , do@@ d@@ i and di@@ an@@ a , he@@ er and ran@@ j@@ ha , this is love ! third my greatest fear is ...
13@@ th after seven years now of being in a wh@@ e@@ el@@ chair , i &apos;ve done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair .
for generations , we &apos;ve been raising our children , not unlike millions of other species living b@@ es@@ i@@ de us .
but it is not a normal movie .
but in fact , if i were to place one base on each pi@@ x@@ el of this 1@@ 2@@ 80 by 800 resolution screen , we would need 3,000 s@@ cre@@ ens to take a look at the genome .
what does this mean for medicine ?
and so what he did was he got his kids se@@ qu@@ en@@ ced .
unless there &apos;s anybody in the audience that would like to v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er to stop eating ?
now think of it , it &apos;s 20@@ 16 and the leading can@@ di@@ date r@@ el@@ e@@ ases not only her four years of back tax re@@ turns , but also her personal genome .
and so i ur@@ ge you all to wake up and to t@@ un@@ e in and to influence the gen@@ om@@ ic revolution that &apos;s happening all around you .
and we have a fle@@ x@@ i@@ ble , powered ca@@ the@@ ter with a special wire loop ti@@ p that sta@@ ys inside the cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y part of the mar@@ row and f@@ ol@@ lo@@ ws the con@@ t@@ ours of the hip , as it moves around .
hopefully this technology will let us have more of these sur@@ vi@@ v@@ or@@ s in the future .
in the br@@ an@@ ch in which the sample radi@@ ates , it sets off a tri@@ g@@ ger that r@@ el@@ e@@ ases po@@ is@@ on and s@@ ch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ ing@@ er is dead .
it &apos;s going to push this energy li@@ mit seven times beyond what &apos;s ever been done before , so we &apos;re going to get to see some new particles very soon .
the most familiar charge is electric charge .
they tell us what interactions are allowed to happen .
this is the way the@@ or@@ ies of uni@@ fication work .
it &apos;s considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics .
now , the only way to maintain san@@ ity and achieve happiness in the mid@@ st of this un@@ c@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ty is to keep balance and perspective in life .
and these patterns of points that i &apos;ve shown for you actually represent sy@@ m@@ me@@ tries of this high-@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ on@@ al object that would be war@@ ping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience .
and we &apos;ve also been hearing about the history , the family tree , of man@@ kind through dna genetic pro@@ fil@@ ing .
in ch@@ im@@ pan@@ z@@ e@@ e society , we find many , many examples of compassion , pre@@ cur@@ s@@ ors to love and true al@@ tru@@ ism .
most important of all , i believe , is working with small groups of women , providing them with opportunities for micro@@ -@@ credit lo@@ ans .
and you know the kind i &apos;m talking about . i &apos;m talking about pollution .
see the bri@@ ck wall as all these problems we &apos;ve in@@ fli@@ cted on the planet , environmental and social . it &apos;s a message of hope .
and un@@ wanted pre@@ g@@ n@@ an@@ cies and things like that , which young people listen to better from other y@@ ou@@ th , rather than adults .
this change , this change . to see change that we must have if we care about the future .
upon working with the plastic , after about the first eight years , some of my work started to f@@ is@@ sure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic .
re@@ cy@@ cl@@ ing -- everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and gre@@ en@@ ing with the idea of re@@ cy@@ cl@@ ing .
and i &apos;m here to un@@ v@@ ei@@ l our latest effort , and most successful effort so far , which is still very much a work in process .
this is ju@@ an &apos;s book , our previous speaker , which gets a great r@@ ating , by the way , at amazon .
at the time , we knew that it was political .
i lost a child when i was 15 , a second child when i was 16 .
i know what it is to suffer , and i feel that if there is a crime , a person should be tried fairly and pun@@ ished . &quot;
but what if it wasn &apos;t ?
however , after a few failed pro@@ t@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ es , i finally came up with this , the li@@ f@@ es@@ a@@ ver bottle .
put that in there . there we go .
okay . li@@ f@@ es@@ a@@ ver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world .
or we could use one of these .
ma@@ o z@@ e@@ d@@ on@@ g used to re@@ f@@ er to them as the european civil wars , and it &apos;s probably a more accurate way of des@@ cri@@ bing them .
my own view , by the way , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is unlikely to be done by sp@@ a@@ w@@ ning more u.n. institutions .
you &apos;re beginning to see the em@@ er@@ gen@@ ce of a multi@@ -@@ polar world .
but that &apos;s no longer true .
the inter@@ relationship of nations , well it &apos;s always existed .
but now one final thing .
but if you ask the average american what the op@@ ti@@ ma@@ l for@@ mul@@ a of lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty is , they probably couldn &apos;t tell you .
it re@@ minds me of my college days .
and research shows that they would be years largely free of ch@@ r@@ on@@ ic disease , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
they have what we want .
we &apos;re down to one and half right now .
and for a while we looked on the pra@@ i@@ ri@@ es of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a , where actually there is a very high pro@@ por@@ tion of c@@ ent@@ en@@ ari@@ ans .
instead they &apos;re talking about their next nature walk , ex@@ changing re@@ ci@@ p@@ es , and yes , they pra@@ y .
and we managed to bo@@ il it down to nine .
they tend to eat a pl@@ an@@ t-@@ based diet .
in the case of this little example i &apos;m holding , we used it to create a touch sen@@ s@@ or that re@@ acts to my skin by turning on this little light .
so many times , a@@ ma@@ te@@ ur@@ s , not experts , have been the inv@@ ent@@ ors and im@@ pro@@ vers of things ran@@ ging from mountain bi@@ kes to se@@ mi@@ con@@ du@@ ctors , personal computers , air@@ pl@@ an@@ es .
back then , computers were these large ma@@ in@@ fra@@ m@@ es only scientists car@@ ed about , and no one d@@ re@@ am@@ ed of even having one at home .
okay ? and all you have to guide you are your two eyes .
right ? i mean , somebody &apos;s seen him .
so we started a separate line of research doing driver state mo@@ d@@ el@@ ing .
and i said , &quot; i can &apos;t take you there , but i can take you into w@@ ei@@ gh@@ t@@ l@@ es@@ s@@ ness into z@@ er@@ o-@@ g .
we had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane .
and you can actually roll some of the pictures now , because i don &apos;t want to look at me on the screen .
no life , from the s@@ m@@ al@@ l@@ est life to everybody here , would be possible without these little micro@@ -@@ machines .
i sho@@ w@@ er@@ ed in cam@@ p@@ gro@@ un@@ ds . i ate out re@@ g@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly .
i hadn &apos;t changed . my i@@ .@@ q@@ . hadn &apos;t dropped .
i was a writer .
so basically , no one would accept family planning if their children didn &apos;t survive .
and then we decided , why not get to religion because in the p@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines , the ca@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c church was pretty strong , and th@@ a@@ i people were bu@@ d@@ d@@ h@@ ist .
we introduced our first micro@@ credit program in 19@@ 7@@ 5 , and the women who organized it said , &quot; we only want to l@@ end to women who practice family planning .
you could call it the co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing .
and then aids education in all schools , starting from university .
and then it says here , with the american fla@@ g , &quot; don &apos;t leave home without it . &quot;
those are the things to be provided by the business community .
can you imagine , at every star@@ bu@@ cks that you can also get con@@ d@@ om@@ s ?
this robot can &apos;t be cre@@ e@@ p@@ y or un@@ can@@ ny .
so i &apos;ll s@@ na@@ p a picture .
and you can actually si@@ mu@@ late that behavior in the bro@@ w@@ s@@ er , which is what you see ro@@ m@@ o doing on the left .
allow me to tell you about my four minutes of f@@ am@@ e .
people like all of you in this room .
she walked el@@ e@@ g@@ an@@ t@@ ly , like a gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e on the african sa@@ van@@ na@@ h , holding the fla@@ g on her shoulder . i jo@@ g@@ ged behind -- on my ti@@ p@@ toes -- holding the fla@@ g on my ex@@ ten@@ ded arm , so that my head was actually under the damn fla@@ g .
i have worked with women and for women all my life .
j@@ en@@ ny re@@ ali@@ zes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth .
she gets the women to plant new trees and water them , drop by drop .
women and children , especially the poor , are at the bottom .
you don &apos;t want to sell too early , because you miss out on pro@@ f@@ its , but you don &apos;t want to wait too late to when everyone else s@@ ell@@ s , tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ing a crash .
but you can see those sp@@ i@@ kes , and they &apos;re there .
so the un@@ informed player &apos;s challenge is to say , &quot; is this guy really being fair or are they giving me a very low offer in order to get me to think that there &apos;s only one or two dollars available to split ? &quot;
next i &apos;m going to introduce you to some rel@@ a@@ ti@@ ves .
we can try . we &apos;ll try . maybe we &apos;ll try .
so here are some things we learned today .
it takes about 10 cal@@ or@@ ies to produce every cal@@ or@@ ie of food that we consume in the west .
so how did a city like this feed itself ?
and then when they hit the eastern end of che@@ ap@@ side , that &apos;s where they were sold , which is why it &apos;s called po@@ ul@@ try .
and this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely .
u@@ t@@ op@@ ia was actually a word that thomas mo@@ ore used de@@ li@@ ber@@ at@@ ely .
ste@@ am@@ ing pil@@ es of hu@@ mu@@ s .
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
this is the source of all morality , this i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ ative act of empathy , putting yourself in the place of another .
and also see that it de@@ m@@ and@@ s ac@@ ute intelligence , not just a go@@ o@@ ey feeling .
so in the current state of manufacturing , we have sk@@ y@@ sc@@ ra@@ pers -- two and a half years &#91; of as@@ se@@ m@@ bly time &#93; , 5@@ 0@@ 0,000 to a million parts , fairly complex , new , exciting technologies in steel , concrete , glass .
the next one questions that and looks at p@@ as@@ si@@ ve nature , or p@@ as@@ si@@ vely trying to have re@@ con@@ fi@@ gu@@ ration pro@@ gra@@ m@@ m@@ ability .
so basically you have a chain of elements .
and when i was in bel@@ o@@ it , wi@@ s@@ con@@ s@@ in , i gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students .
and this is something we com@@ mon@@ ly do to look for res@@ p@@ ir@@ atory viruses like in@@ flu@@ en@@ z@@ a .
there are un@@ k@@ no@@ w@@ ns all around us and they &apos;re just waiting to be discovered .
so can we have the lights off , please , so we can see it ?
so we are a chemical sc@@ um that is different . this chemical sc@@ um has uni@@ ver@@ s@@ ality .
but i have to tell you -- and sorry , richard -- but i never did like biology field tri@@ ps much , and i think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years .
the world is bu@@ z@@ zing at the moment with plans to force re@@ du@@ ctions in gas emissions at all costs .
he &apos;s seen that it &apos;s possible to have a different set of rules , rules where businesses ear@@ n a small profit , so they have an in@@ c@@ en@@ tive to sign up more customers .
both of these countries are dark compared to pu@@ er@@ to ri@@ co , which has half as many resi@@ d@@ ents as either haiti or the d@@ om@@ in@@ i@@ can re@@ public .
one of the z@@ ones next to h@@ on@@ g k@@ on@@ g has a city called sh@@ en@@ z@@ h@@ en .
people can come live under the new char@@ ter , but no one is forced to live under it .
many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can op@@ t into as a rule .
how would we write the tre@@ at@@ y to do that ?
gen@@ om@@ ics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was , by the end of this year , we might have between three and five gen@@ om@@ es se@@ qu@@ en@@ ced ; it &apos;s on the order of several hundred .
when there &apos;s a lot of ch@@ l@@ or@@ op@@ hy@@ l@@ l around , they see a lot of green light .
the pool ex@@ p@@ and@@ ed a little bit if we ig@@ nor@@ ed one in@@ tra@@ c@@ ell@@ ul@@ ar par@@ as@@ i@@ te ; it ex@@ p@@ and@@ ed even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 3@@ 10 or so .
it re@@ as@@ se@@ m@@ bles its genome after this radiation bur@@ st in about 12 to 24 hours , after its ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ s@@ om@@ es are literally b@@ lo@@ wn apart .
let me just close with ethical and policy studies .
of course it pa@@ ys , if you like mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws , to wait .
we &apos;re going to call them &quot; fu@@ tu@@ re-@@ ori@@ ent@@ ed . &quot; their focus is on what will be .
and it res@@ on@@ ated for me . i grew up as a poor kid in the south br@@ on@@ x gh@@ et@@ to , a si@@ ci@@ li@@ an family -- everyone lived in the past and present .
well , let &apos;s take science .
and here &apos;s a beautiful picture of the and@@ ro@@ me@@ da ne@@ bu@@ la , which is our clo@@ s@@ est , largest sp@@ i@@ ra@@ l galaxy to the m@@ il@@ ky way .
it &apos;s cold , it &apos;s e@@ er@@ ie , it &apos;s mi@@ sty , it might be ra@@ in@@ ing , and you might be standing on the sh@@ or@@ es of lake mi@@ ch@@ ig@@ an bri@@ m@@ m@@ ing with paint th@@ in@@ ner .
and i can &apos;t tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of ti@@ tan &apos;s surface from the pro@@ be . and this is what we saw .
ok , so this is our movie of the e@@ qu@@ at@@ ori@@ al region of ti@@ tan , showing these d@@ un@@ es . these are d@@ un@@ es that are 100 meters tall , separated by a few kilometers , and they go on for miles and miles and miles .
right now , earth is the only planet still that we know is te@@ em@@ ing with life .
they would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded , so they would lose free access to the rest of the west bank .
prote@@ ster : this is a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful march .
so we organized a s@@ cre@@ en@@ ing .
and it took them four days .
and like the rest of the brain , it &apos;s made of neurons .
and indeed , on the in@@ puts to the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pu@@ s , cells are found which project into the hi@@ p@@ po@@ cam@@ pu@@ s , which do respond exactly to de@@ te@@ cting boundaries or ed@@ ges at particular di@@ st@@ an@@ ces and directions from the r@@ at or mouse as it &apos;s exploring around .
and that would be represented by the fi@@ r@@ ing of bo@@ un@@ dar@@ y-@@ de@@ te@@ cting cells .
he wasn &apos;t the only man who su@@ ff@@ ered in a pre-@@ civil rights america , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the only great or@@ ator of the day .
and why should anyone care ?
people don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it .
the ne@@ o@@ cortex is responsible for all of our rational and an@@ al@@ y@@ tic@@ al thought and language .
it &apos;s always the same three things , so let &apos;s explore that .
and if you talk about what you believe , you will at@@ tra@@ ct those who believe what you believe .
the reason that person bought the iphone in the first six hours , stood in line for six hours , was because of what they believed about the world , and how they wanted everybody to see them : they were first .
people don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it , and what you do simply ser@@ ves as the proof of what you believe .
and , by the way , he gave the &quot; i have a dream &quot; speech , not the &quot; i have a plan &quot; speech .
i &apos;ll never forget , the t@@ v@@ s played this end@@ less re@@ el of car@@ to@@ ons .
and when the office of economic opportunity in washington , d@@ .@@ c. -- which was funding g@@ ei@@ ger &apos;s clinic -- they were fu@@ ri@@ ous .
and we chose to use the pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion for that purpose .
what if we had a waiting room where you don &apos;t just sit when you &apos;re sick , but where you go to get healthy .
and they leave with the con@@ vi@@ ction , the ability and the e@@ ff@@ ic@@ ac@@ y to realize our most basic as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions for health care .
i believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare , it will not be by the diseases cu@@ red , but by the diseases pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ed .
pi@@ ra@@ cy is a very active threat today around the world . this is in the indian ocean .
we caught it with that low-@@ tech ra@@ ft — — and it was carrying six tons of co@@ ca@@ ine .
ei@@ gh@@ t@@ y-@@ five percent cannot read when they enter the security forces of afghanistan .
multi@@ p@@ ly this by 4@@ 0@@ 0,000 patient treatments , this pri@@ v@@ at@@ e-@@ public collaboration with security forces , and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way .
which i do .
remember that sort of , um . this is the joke i did when the fl@@ ori@@ da bal@@ lot was going around . you know , count the dots for gore ; count the dots for bush ; count &apos; em again ...
the bu@@ b@@ bles are the countries .
some countries still had statistics .
but we have to bring united states forward quite a while to find the same health of the united states as we have in the p@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ines .
and this changes gra@@ du@@ ally .
now this looks also like a very good story .
what they ear@@ n here -- what number they live on -- is how much they ear@@ n per day .
